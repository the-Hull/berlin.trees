## Purpose

This repository contains an analysis of tree growth (potential) and its relationship with the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in Berlin using an extensive, publicly available data set. 
For some details of the (on-going) research, download this [file](./analysis/paper/paper.html)

## Approach

The folder structure follows the principal of a [research compendium](https://research-compendium.science/) following concepts developed by [Ben Marwick and others](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986?journalCode=utas20).
That means all analyses and the final write-up are organized in a (fairly) coherent manner, encouraing reproducibility.

I chose to package up the analyses in an `R` package to facilitate reproducibility, as dependencies are more easily tracked, and analyses steps can be broken down into functions that can be tested, adjusted when necessary, and most important, re-used.
