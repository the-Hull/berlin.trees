  abstract = {A study is made of the effect of air temperature on the start of the pollen seasons of three tree species-Ulmus, Platanus and Olea-in the southeastern Iberian Peninsula. These initial results are based on an aerobiological analysis performed over a 4-year period in the city of Granada, Spain. Sampling was carried out with a Burkard spore trap. The main aim of the present study was to use regression analysis to identify the preseasonal date when these species start to accumulate heat in their floral buds, enabling models to be created that indicate the onset of the pollen season for these taxa. For Ulmus there was no significant correlation between the onset of pollination and the mean temperature during the preceding period, whereas Platanus presented a significant correlation with mean temperature during the month of January, and Olea with mean temperature during the second fortnight in February and the month of March. For Ulmus, the start of the pollen season ranged between 30 January and 8 February; for Platanus, between 13 and 17 March; and for Olea, between 20 April and 13 May. The accumulated temperature needed to induce the onset of flowering ranged between 121 and 256°C for Ulmus, with values of 428-607°C and 656-881°C for Platanus and Olea, respectively.},

  abstract = {A large number of vehicles routinely navigate through city streets; with on-board sensors, they can be transformed into a dynamic network that monitors the urban environment comprehensively and efficiently. In this paper, driveby approaches are discussed as a form of mobile sensing, that offer a number of advantages over more traditional sensing approaches. It is shown that the physical properties of the urban environment that can be captured using drive-by sensing include Ambient Fluid, Electromagnetic, Urban Envelope, Photonic, and Acoustic properties, which comprise the FEELS classification. In addition, the spatiotemporal variations of these phenomena are discussed as well as their implications on discrete-time sampling. The mobility patterns of sensor-hosting vehicles play a major role in drive-by sensing. Vehicles with scheduled trajectories, e.g., buses, and those with less predictable mobility patterns, e.g., taxis, are investigated for sensing efficacy in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. City Scanner is a drive-by approach with a modular sensing architecture, which enables cost-effective mass data acquisition on a multitude of city features. The City Scanner framework follows a centralized IoT regime to generate a near real-time visualization of sensed data. The sensing platform was mounted on top of garbage trucks and collected drive-by data for eight months in Cambridge, MA, USA. Acquired data were streamed to the cloud for processing and subsequent analyses. Based on a real-world application, we discuss and show the potential of using drive-by approaches to collect environmental data in urban areas using a variety of non-dedicated land vehicles to optimize data collection in terms of spatiotemporal coverage.},

Yet, their high cost of deployment and maintenance often result in an accurate but geographicallysparse monitoring. We advocate for a drive-by approach to urban sensing in which vehicles are used as sensors to scan the city with a high spatiotemporal resolution. We present City Scanner, a highly-customizable, self-sufficient platform that allows for cost-efficient drive-by sensing. City Scanner modules can be deployed on existing vehicles (e.g. busses and taxis) without interfering with their operations. We describe our first prototype that includes sensing modules for air quality, temperature, humidity, and thermal imaging. We discuss the challenges we encountered during an 8-months deployment of the platform on trash trucks in order to derive implications for the design of future drive-by sensing systems.},

  abstract = {Recently, portable sensors, with high accuracy and embedded communication technologies, have become available and affordable. By deploying such sensors on various urban vehicles that routinely navigate through city streets, vehicles can form a dynamic network for comprehensively and efficiently monitoring the urban environment. This drive-by sensing approach benefits also from the lower costs of sensor deployment and maintenance compared to stationary sensor networks. However, the data sampling frequency and spatial granularity of measurements are constrained by factors such as topology of the underlying street network and mobility pattern of sensor-equipped vehicles. In this paper we investigate the effect of street network topology on the quality of data captured through drive-by sensing. To this end, we first study the temporal aspects of drive-by sensing and present a quantitative method for comparing various street networks. Then, we consider the spatial aspects of drive-by sensing by defining a sensing-potential indicator for urban areas based on the geometrical properties of the street networks. This indicator is then combined with vehicle mobility patterns derived to measure the sensing potential of routes and cycles. In this context, we define the novel concept of Sensogram for describing the spatial sensing potential of network cycles using dedicated vehicles.},

  abstract = {In this work the analysis of the surface and air heat island in Milan, Italy, by means of satellite maps is proposed. The urban heat island (UHI) maps were produced using data provided by the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on board of both Terra and Aqua satellites. Two types of UHI were analyzed simultaneously: the canopy layer heat island (CLHI) and the surface urban heat island (SUHI). The aim of this work is the realization of the SUHI and CLHI maps to monitor the spatial and temporal evolution of surface and air heating; also, to highlight and quantify the different features (e.g. magnitude, spatial extent, orientation and UHI center location) a Gaussian surface was used to fit the spatially distributed heat island patterns.The analysis during summer months points out that the SUHI effect is a noticeable phenomenon throughout the whole diurnal cycle: it has a stronger intensity in the daytime with peaks around 9-10. K while in the nighttime, in the absence of solar forcing, it decreases by a factor of 2. In contrast, the canopy layer heat island during the daytime is absent: the CLHI emerges after sunset with an average intensity around 3-4. K, showing features similar to the nighttime SUHI.In addition, comparisons between UHI intensity and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) were performed, confirming that green areas can contribute to the mitigation of this phenomenon. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

With the expansion of urban areas in Turkey during the past decades, urban green spaces have been fragmented and dispersed causing impairment and environmental degradation. The purpose of this study is to model urban green space distribution by focusing on the landscape fragmentation in city of Osmaniye using remote sensing and geographic information system technology. Normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and urban landscape ratio (ULR) were used to assess the proximity and spatial arrangement of urban green spaces within the neighbor landscapes to quantify the urban land use effect. The geospatial analysis results showed that increase in total built-up area and population has significantly decreased the urban green space cover because of high levels of landscape fragmentation in urban city center. Also, due to high levels of landscape fragmentation, approximately 45\% of the Osmaniye city is estimated to become urbanized by 2030. This study demonstrated the benefits of directional vegetation index application with geospatial analyses in characterizing the environmental quality for planning and management of urban green spaces. This approach could be used for determining the future urban land development scenarios correlating with regional planning procedures. © 2018, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The data were acquired on august 13, 1998 over the Montreal Island, period of the year when the vegetation is in the maximum phonological stage. A combined correction of the atmospheric effects (scattering and absorption) and the radiometric drift of the sensor were applied to transform the raw data to the surface reflectance. The validation of the obtained results according to the ground truth shows that the TDVI is a very good tool for vegetation cover monitoring in urban environment. It does not saturate like NDVI or SAVI, it shows a good linearity as a function of vegetation cover rate. © 2007 IEEE.},

  abstract = {Plants use light as a source of both energy and information. Plant physiological responses to light, and interactions between plants and animals (such as herbivory and pollination), have evolved under a more or less stable regime of 24-h cycles of light and darkness, and, outside of the tropics, seasonal variation in day length. The rapid spread of outdoor electric lighting across the globe over the past century has caused an unprecedented disruption to these natural light cycles. Artificial light is widespread in the environment, varying in intensity by several orders of magnitude from faint skyglow reflected from distant cities to direct illumination of urban and suburban vegetation. In many cases, artificial light in the night-time environment is sufficiently bright to induce a physiological response in plants, affecting their phenology, growth form and resource allocation. The physiology, behaviour and ecology of herbivores and pollinators are also likely to be impacted by artificial light. Thus, understanding the ecological consequences of artificial light at night is critical to determine the full impact of human activity on ecosystems. Synthesis. Understanding the impacts of artificial night-time light on wild plants and natural vegetation requires linking the knowledge gained from over a century of experimental research on the impacts of light on plants in the laboratory and glasshouse with knowledge of the intensity, spatial distribution, spectral composition and timing of light in the night-time environment. To understand fully the extent of these impacts requires conceptual models that can (i) characterize the highly heterogeneous nature of the night-time light environment at a scale relevant to plant physiology; and (ii) scale physiological responses to predict impacts at the level of the whole plant, population, community and ecosystem.

We aimed to investigate (1) sensitization rates and (2) cross-sensitization patterns in skin prick tests (SPTs) for the most relevant inhaled allergens in central Germany over 20 years, adjusted for regional pollen counts. Patients and Methods: This monocentric study evaluated SPTs for tree pollen, grass pollen and house dust mites (HDMs) in 4,315 patients (including children) with suspected airway allergies, from 1998–2017. Results: Sensitization rates to almost all aeroallergens have increased significantly over time, without relevant changes in regional pollen counts. Current sensitization rates in all our symptomatic patients were highest for grass (55.3 \%) and rye pollen (59.6 \%), with most pronounced increases in HDM sensitization over time (from 37.8 \% to the current figure of 50.1 \%). However, a low but consistent proportion of tree-sensitized patients (3.6–7.8 \%) showed isolated positive SPTs to alder and/or hazel pollen without sensitization to birch pollen. Conclusions We demonstrate a significant rise in the total number of sensitized patients as well as increases in cross-sensitization between closely related allergens. Individuals with unusual mono-sensitization profiles to common inhaled allergens should be studied in more detail, since these patients are currently excluded from clinical trials for allergen immunotherapy.},

Vegetation cover size and temporal growing rates in the park area in Ankara were determined by employing Remote Sensing Technology. The results were assessed using Kappa statistics. Green area detection accuracies from NDVI, SAVI and GVI were 71, 73 and 56\%, respectively. Additionally, the 1989 and 2006 green areas of Altinpark were compared with each other to see the temporal growth of green cover in the park area. Green cover change was detected to be 43.9 ha.},

  abstract = {Up-to-date catalogs of the urban tree population are of importance for municipalities to monitor and improve quality of life in cities. Despite much research on automation of tree mapping, mainly relying on dedicated airborne LiDAR or hyperspectral campaigns, tree detection and species recognition is still mostly done manually in practice. We present a fully automated tree detection and species recognition pipeline that can process thousands of trees within a few hours using publicly available aerial and street view images of Google MapsTM. These data provide rich information from different viewpoints and at different scales from global tree shapes to bark textures. Our work-flow is built around a supervised classification that automatically learns the most discriminative features from thousands of trees and corresponding, publicly available tree inventory data. In addition, we introduce a change tracker that recognizes changes of individual trees at city-scale, which is essential to keep an urban tree inventory up-todate. The system takes street-level images of the same tree location at two different times and classifies the type of change (e.g., tree has been removed). Drawing on recent advances in computer vision and machine learning, we apply convolutional neural networks (CNN) for all classification tasks. We propose the following pipeline: download all available panoramas and overhead images of an area of interest, detect trees per image and combine multi-view detections in a probabilistic framework, adding prior knowledge; recognize fine-grained species of detected trees. In a later, separate module, track trees over time, detect significant changes and classify the type of change. We believe this is the first work to exploit publicly available image data for city-scale street tree detection, species recognition and change tracking, exhaustively over several square kilometers, respectively many thousands of trees. Experiments in the city of Pasadena, California, USA show that we can detect {$>$}70\% of the street trees, assign correct species to {$>$}80\% for 40 different species, and correctly detect and classify changes in {$>$}90\% of the cases.},

We evaluated the spatial and quantitative distributions, and temporal trends of NDII derived from Landsat 8 imagery, NDII = (NIR–SWIR)/(NIR+SWIR) or NDII = (Band5–Band6)/(Band5+Band6), over a typical medium-sized European city with its surroundings. The temporal changes of NDII were also correlated with sunshine duration, temperature, and precipitation. Vegetation was the component of land cover that was changing to the highest degree during the growing season. The most dynamic temporal alterations of NDII were recorded within the arable land. In forest areas and grassland NDII was relatively stable through the summer. The NDII values were stable also in the built-up area in view of practically constant state of human-made covers in the studied period. NDII can support the monitoring of land cover/land use in the urban and rural areas, provided that the images of fully developed plant cover are used. It was stated that NDII correlated with weather conditions. The relationships between NDII and precipitation, temperature, and sunshine duration could facilitate risk assessment and planning of agronomic practices with regard to the weather. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The length of the growth period was affected by irrigation regimes in regard to termination of growth, as the trees receiving 640 L (169 gal) had a growth period significantly longer than the control trees. These results indicate that growth and growth period of street trees are augmented by an increase in the amount of water available to them. In addition, block effects concerning the start of the growth period were observed, as trees situated on the northern side of the street initiated stem growth 7 days earlier than the trees on the southern side. © 2006 International Society of Arboriculture.},

  abstract = {Plant phenological records are crucial for predicting plant responses to global warming. However, many historical records are either short or replete with data gaps, which pose limitations and may lead to erroneous conclusions about the direction and magnitude of change. In addition to uninterrupted monitoring, missing observations may be substituted via modeling, experimentation, or gradient analysis. Here we have developed a space-for-time (SFT) substitution method that uses spatial phenology and temperature data to fill gaps in historical records. To do this, we combined historical data for several tree species from a single location with spatial data for the same species and used linear regression and Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA) to build complementary spring phenology models and assess improvements achieved by the approach. SFT substitution allowed increasing the sample size and developing more robust phenology models for some of the species studied. Testing models with reduced historical data size revealed thresholds at which SFT improved historical trend estimation. We conclude that under certain circumstances both the robustness of models and accuracy of phenological trends can be enhanced although some limitations and assumptions still need to be resolved. There is considerable potential for exploring SFT analyses in phenology studies, especially those conducted in urban environments and those dealing with non-linearities in phenology modeling. © 2012 Buyantuyev et al.},

  abstract = {Urbanization transforms vegetation pattern and ecosystem processes which are controlled primarily by climate in desert regions. The objective of this study was to investigate how urbanization affects vegetation phenology and its coupling with climate in the Phoenix metropolitan region, USA. Our analysis of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time-series reveals a complex pattern of land surface phenology in response to urbanization. Croplands and urbanized areas show growth multimodality, which is usually found in riparian areas of the region but absent in the native desert. Agriculture is characterized by the shortest growth length and fastest greening and senescing rates. Conversely, urban vegetation stays photosynthetically active for longer periods. Desert NDVI is regulated by 3-5 month accumulated precipitation, but riparian vegetation is uncorrelated with rainfall. NDVI spatial patterns are best predicted by climatic variables near the peak of annual growth. Spring and summer NDVI is in better agreement with precipitation accumulated over longer time periods, while early autumn growth is strongly correlated with immediate and one-month rainfall. Temperature correlates negatively with desert but positively with riparian NDVI. Managed vegetation growth is decoupled from precipitation and completely unsynchronized with natural desert vegetation. Overall, urbanization has resulted in a greater phenological diversity that is not in sync with climatic variability. Our findings provide new insights into the interactions among vegetation growth, climate variability, and urbanization in dry lands. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The general trend of ongoing plant invasion and the increasing number of species that may become invasive in the future, force seeking solutions that can improve the efficiency and economy of their management. Thus, we applied a novel approach combining the use of geostatistical interpolators such as ordinary kriging (OK) and co-kriging (CK) with environmental and hyperspectral data to evaluate the potential threat associated with the distribution of invasive plant species and to predict their probabilities of occurrence above the selected threshold of 10\%. The specific spatial patterns of the probability of occurrence of Heracleum sosnowskyi and Fallopia spp. were modelled in two study areas in southern Poland. The significant achievement of this study was the application of geostatistical tools producing results characterized by a degree of precision quantified by cross-validation errors, and prediction errors after field verification. OK and CK returned root mean squared error (RMSE) values in a range from 0.21 to 0.51 and 0.21 to 0.47, respectively. For OK and CK, the prediction errors resulting from field verification in the following year were between 0.03–0.39, and 0.03–0.29, respectively. Additionally, the study provided the first prediction maps (2D) and Digital Prediction Models (DPMs) (3D) visualizations of the probability of occurrence of both invasive plants. Although the proposed approach is illustrated with real case studies related to Heracleum sosnowskyi and Fallopia spp., it could be extended to other species. This demonstrates the potential of an effective alternative strategy for evaluating the risk posed by invasive plants, that will be able to provide fast, low cost and effective prediction and monitoring of their spread. For institutions dealing with invasive plants, this may be beneficial and help to reduce the negative consequences of their improper management. © 2020 University of Silesia},

Plant phenology is a sensitive and easily observed biological indicator to detect these impacts, and its responses to UHI have become hotspots in the fields of urban ecology and global climate change. This paper reviewed related researches in recent years. It points out that there are three major ways to obtain urban phenology, that is, field observation, phenology modeling and remote sensing monitoring. Through cooperating with the public and employing photos and multi-resolution images, we can enrich the phenology data. Due to the impacts of UHI, spring phenology in urban area has been earlier than the surrounding rural area; however, the impact mechanism is still controversial. At temporal scale, spring phenology has advanced and autumn phenology has delayed induced by urban warming. Urban warming is caused by UHI and climate warming, and how to quantitatively discern their contributions is difficult. In addition, biological factors (e. g. plant functional types and exotic plants) and geographical location have affected the plant phenological responses to UHI. Thus, this paper proposes that future researches need to eliminate the interference factors, and enhance the researches in response mechanisms. © 2014, Editorial Board of Chinese Journal of Ecology.

  abstract = {Airborne pollen cause seasonal allergies and the number of people affected increases yearly due to global warming and urbanization. Governmental pollen sensing stations are sampling traps which require manual pollen identification and counting by trained personnel in the lab. In the past years, a number of researchers and startups started working towards automated pollen measurements by exploring a wide range of techniques. Many solutions reported in the literature are expensive or work for a limited number of pollen species. In this paper, we present the design of a prototype of an automated and affordable pollen detection device built from off-the-shelf components. The design consists of three subsystems operating in the field and communicating the data to the backend server: (1) a particle trap with automatic filtering, (2) a particle concentration subsystem, and (3) a digital transmitted light microscope with layer-wise focus. The prototype shows effective particle gathering, filtering and concentration in a tiny-sized area. As a result, we reduce particle loss and improve image quality taken by the optical system when searching and focusing on pollen grains. The test results show that our device achieves high efficiency with up to 150 l/min air flow rates, evaluates over 90 \% of captured pollen grains, and achieves 1 h measurement delay on average (2 h at maximum). The prototype collects raw time-stamped microscopic images of pollen with 5-60 depth layers per sample depending on the number of objects contained in one sample. All images are transmitted to the backend server where we run a pollen detection algorithm to extract individual pollen grains from every image. We achieve 0.90 average precision and F1-score of 0.88 when detecting pollen in the images of individual layers taken in the field. Our prototype successfully operated in the wild for 115 days between April and August 2019, and shows high stability under a wide range of varying weather conditions, little maintenance need and low device-to-device variation.},

  abstract = {Using land surface temperatures (LST) derived from remotely sensed data, numerous studies have shown that not only urban areas are warmer than surrounding rural areas, but within urban areas, there are large spatial variations in temperature. Few studies, however, have investigated the spatial variation of air temperature within a city. Using air temperature data collected from 117 weather stations in Shenzhen for the year of 2017, we quantified the within-city spatial pattern of air temperature and its nocturnal and seasonal variability. We further investigated the quantitative relationship between air temperature and LST and compared their spatiotemporal patterns. We found that: 1) Air temperature varied greatly in space, showing very strong spatial heterogeneity and having large nocturnal and seasonal variability; 2) The spatial and temporal variation is more prominent during extreme heat days, during which the difference of hourly maximum temperature among stations could reach 8.7 °C around 16:00 and remain as high as 8.6 °C until 23:00, indicating that locations in cities with higher temperatures may suffer more intensive and longer excessive urban heat, and thereby global warming may exacerbate the difference in air temperature at the local scale; 3) LST had significantly positive correlations with air temperature, especially in the summer night, but their cool and hot spots did not always overlap in space. Results can enhance understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of the urban thermal environment and have practical implications on excessive urban heat mitigation and adaptation in an increasingly warming global climate. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

The design consists of three subsystems operating in the field and communicating the data to the backend server: (1) a particle trap with automatic filtering, (2) a particle concentration subsystem, and (3) a digital transmitted light microscope with layer-wise focus. The prototype shows effective particle gathering, filtering and concentration in a tiny-sized area. As a result, we reduce particle loss and improve image quality taken by the optical system when searching and focusing on pollen grains. The test results show that our device achieves high efficiency with up to 150 l/min air flow rates, evaluates over 90 \% of captured pollen grains, and achieves 1 h measurement delay on average (2 h at maximum). The prototype collects raw time-stamped microscopic images of pollen with 5-60 depth layers per sample depending on the number of objects contained in one sample. All images are transmitted to the backend server where we run a pollen detection algorithm to extract individual pollen grains from every image. We achieve 0.90 average precision and F1-score of 0.88 when detecting pollen in the images of individual layers taken in the field. Our prototype successfully operated in the wild for 115 days between April and August 2019, and shows high stability under a wide range of varying weather conditions, little maintenance need and low device-to-device variation.},

  abstract = {Platanusx hispanica (London plane) is a tree species widely used in urban areas due to the diversity of ecosystem services it provides. However, its functions also have some negative effects or associated disservices, such as the emission of Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds (BVOCs) and allergens. This work aims to analyze the effect that urban environmental conditions and air pollutants have on pollen emissions of plane tree. The study has been carried out in Granada, in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula, a city with a Mediterranean climate and one of the most polluted in Spain. Granada is also one of the Mediterranean cities in which the increase in the percentage of the population affected by allergy to Platanus pollen in recent decades has been most significant. The 1992–2019 Platanus pollen data series has been considered to establish the main aerobiological parameters, trends and correlations with meteorological variables and particulate and gaseous atmospheric pollutants, both before and during the flowering period. The average Seasonal Pollen Integral (SPIn) of about 2700 pollen grains has shown a significant increase throughout the series. This increase in allergen emissions could be related to the increase in crown volume associated with tree growth, but also to other environmental factors. Precipitation and minimum temperatures of the winter prior to flowering were the parameters that have shown the most influence with SPIn, while O3 and NOx are the pollutants that have the most effect on the peak value. Due to the good adaptation that London plane has to changing climatic conditions in urban environments, its hegemonic presence as an element of Urban Green infrastructure must be reviewed so that the net balance of ecosystem services is not diminished by the disservices.},

We analysed Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images to investigate the onset, offset and length of growing season, as well as spatial and inter-annual patterns of Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) across six types of vegetation/land use in Taiwan. Regression models indicate that temperature was moderately to strongly related to NDVI for each of the six vegetation/ land-use types (coefficients of determination (R2) = 0.45-0.86). There was a 1-2 month lag time between changes in temperature and NDVI in the forests that are distributed in mid- to high-elevation areas, but not in low-elevation unirrigated fields, paddy fields and urban areas. The relationship between precipitation and changes in NDVI was only significant for unirrigated fields and urban areas (R2 = 0.37-0.43). Growing season ended considerably earlier at low elevations than at high elevations, possibly because of the earlier start and more severe dry period in low-elevation areas, such that the length of the growing season was longer in the forests than in the unirrigated fields, paddy fields and urban areas. © 2011 Taylor \&amp; Francis.},

  abstract = {The surface urban heat island (SUHI) is one of the most significant human-induced alterations to the Earth's surface climate and can aggravate health risks for city dwellers during heat waves. Although the SUHI effect has received growing attention, its diurnal cycles (i.e., the variations over the full 24 h within the diel cycle) are poorly understood because polar-orbiting satellites (e.g., Landsat Series, Sentinel, Terra, Aqua) only provide one or two observations over each repeat cycle (e.g., 16 days) with constant overpass time for the same area. Geostationary satellites provide high-frequency land surface temperature (LST) observations throughout the day and the night, and thereby offer unprecedented opportunities for exploring the diurnal cycles of SUHI. Here we examined how the SUHI intensity varied over the course of the diurnal cycle in the Boston Metropolitan Area using LST observations from the NOAA's latest generation of Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites (GOES-R). GOES-R LST was strongly correlated with MODIS LST (R2 = 0.98, p \&lt; 0.0001) across urban core, suburban, and rural areas. We calculated the SUHI intensity at an hourly time step for both the urban core and suburban areas using GOES-R LST data. The maximum SUHI intensity for the urban core occurred near noon, and was +3.0 °C (12:00), +5.4 °C (12:00), +4.9 °C (11:00), and +3.7 °C (12:00) in winter, spring, summer, and autumn, respectively. The maximum intensity for the suburban area was about 3.0 °C lower in spring and summer and 2.0 °C lower in autumn and winter than that of the urban-core area. The minimum SUHI intensity occurred at nighttime, and ranged from −1.0 °C to +1.0 °C. The difference in the nighttime SUHI intensity between urban core and suburban area was insignificant for all seasons except the summer. The SUHI intensity showed similar diurnal variations across the seasons. Throughout the year, the maximum SUHI intensity (+2.7–+5.8 °C) at the urban core occurred at 11:00–14:00 (local time), while the minimum SUHI intensity (−0.6–+0.9 °C) was commonly observed at 00:00–07:00 and 17:00–23:00. We also found different relationships between SUHI intensity and potential drivers within a diurnal cycle, characterized by the strongest correlation with impervious surface area and population size during the middle of the day, and with tree canopy cover at night. Our research highlights the great potential of the new-generation geostationary satellites in revealing the detailed diurnal variations of SUHI. Our findings have implications for informing urban planning and public health risk management. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The goal of this study was to quantitatively assess the relationship linking vegetation and airborne pollen. For this, we established six sampling stations in the city of Thessaloniki, Greece. Once every week for 2~years, we recorded airborne pollen in them, at breast height, by use of a portable volumetric sampler. We also made a detailed analysis of the vegetation in each station by counting all existing individuals of the woody species contributing pollen to the air, in five zones of increasing size, from 4 to 40~ha. We found the local vegetation to be the driver of the spatial variation of pollen in the air of the city. Even at very neighbouring stations, only 500~m apart, considerable differences in vegetation composition were expressed in the pollen spectrum. We modelled the pollen concentration of each pollen taxon as a function of the abundance of the woody species corresponding to that taxon by use of a Generalized Linear Model. The relationship was significant for the five most abundantly represented taxa in the pollen spectrum of the city. It is estimated that every additional individual of Cupressaceae, Pinaceae, Platanus, Ulmus and Olea increases pollen in the air by approximately 0.7, 0.2, 2, 6 and 5\%, respectively. Whether the relationships detected for the above pollen taxa hold outside the domain for which we have data, as well as under different environmental conditions and/or with different assemblages of species representing them are issues to be explored in the future.},

Firstly, an object detection and tracking approach was firstly carried out within two deep learning approaches: You Only Look Once (YOLO) V3 and Single Shot Detector (SSD). A comparison between the two methods allows us to identify their applicability in the traffic environment. Both the performances in road and in railway environments were evaluated. Secondly, object distance estimation based on Monodepth algorithm was developed. This model is trained on stereo images dataset but its inference uses monocular images. As the output data, we have a disparity map that we combine with the output of object detection. To validate our approach, we have tested two models with different backbones including VGG and ResNet used with two datasets: Cityscape and KITTI. As the last step of our approach, we have developed a new method-based SSD to analyse the behavior of pedestrian and vehicle by tracking their movements even in case of no detection on some images of a sequence. We have developed an algorithm based on the coordinates of the output bounding boxes of the SSD algorithm. The objective is to determine if the trajectory of a pedestrian or vehicle can lead to a dangerous situations. The whole of development is tested in real vehicle traffic conditions in Rouen city center, and with videos taken by embedded cameras along the Rouen tramway.},

The majority of methods available for estimating L is ideally applicable at stand scale and is therefore poorly suitable in urban settings, where trees are typically sparse and isolated. In addition, accurate measurements in urban settings are hindered by proximity of trees to infrastructure elements, which can strongly affect the accuracy of tree canopy analysis. In this study we tested whether digital photography can be used to obtain indirect estimate of L of isolated trees. The sampled species were Platanus orientalis, Liquidambar styraciflua and Juglans regia. Upward-facing photography was used to estimate gap fraction and foliage clumping from images collected in unobstructed (open areas) and obstructed (nearby buildings) settings; two image classification methods provided accurate estimates of gap fraction, based on comparison with measurements obtained from a high quality quantum sensor (LAI-2000). Leveled photography was used to characterize the leaf angle distribution of the examined tree species. L estimates obtained combining the two photographic methods agreed well with direct L measurements obtained from harvesting. We conclude that digital photography is suitable for estimating leaf area in isolated urban trees, due to its simple, fast and cost-effective procedures. Use of vegetation indices allows extending significantly the applicability of the photographic method in urban settings, including green roofs and vertical greenery systems.},

  abstract = {Urbanization has led to a reduction in green spaces and thus transformed the spatial pattern of urban land use. An increase in air temperature directly affects forest vegetation, phenology, and biodiversity in urban areas. In this paper, we analyze the changing land use patterns and urban heat distribution (UHD) in Seoul on the basis of a spatial assessment. It is necessary to monitor and assess the functions of green spaces in order to understand the changes in the green space. In addition, we estimated the influence of green space on urban temperature using Landsat 7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) imagery and climatic data. Results of the assessment showed that UHD differences cause differences in temperature variation and the spatial extent of temperature reducing effects due to urban green space. The ratio of urban heat area to green space cooling area increases rapidly with increasing distance from a green space boundary. This shows that urban green space plays an important role for mitigating urban heating in central areas. This study demonstrated the importance of green space by characterizing the spatiotemporal variations in temperature associated with urban green spaces.},

  abstract = {Many organisms rely on synchronizing the timing of their life-history events with those of other trophic levels—known as phenological matching—for survival or successful reproduction. In temperate deciduous forests, the extent of matching with the budburst date of key tree species is of particular relevance for many herbivorous insects and, in turn, insectivorous birds. In order to understand the ecological and evolutionary forces operating in these systems, we require knowledge of the factors influencing leaf emergence of tree communities. However, little is known about how phenology at the level of individual trees varies across landscapes, or how consistent this spatial variation is between different tree species. Here, we use field observations, collected over 2 years, to characterize within- and between-species differences in spring phenology for 825 trees of six species (Quercus robur, Fraxinus excelsior, Fagus sylvatica, Betula pendula, Corylus avellana, and Acer pseudoplatanus) in a 385-ha woodland. We explore environmental predictors of individual variation in budburst date and bud development rate and establish how these phenological traits vary over space. Trees of all species showed markedly consistent individual differences in their budburst timing. Bud development rate also varied considerably between individuals and was repeatable in oak, beech, and sycamore. We identified multiple predictors of budburst date including altitude, local temperature, and soil type, but none were universal across species. Furthermore, we found no evidence for interspecific covariance of phenology over space within the woodland. These analyses suggest that phenological landscapes are highly complex, varying over small spatial scales both within and between species. Such spatial variation in vegetation phenology is likely to influence patterns of selection on phenology within populations of consumers. Knowledge of the factors shaping the phenological environments experienced by animals is therefore likely to be key in understanding how these evolutionary processes operate.},

  abstract = {Changes in phenology are indicators of climate change. Urban land use influences local climates through mechanisms such as urban heat island (UHI) effects. This research examined the spatio-temporal variations in first flowering with changes in urban land use in England and Wales. It used standard ordinary least squares (OLSs) regressions and geographically weighted regressions (GWRs) to analyse changes in phenophase observation date between 1934 and 2007 for three tree species. The OLS models suggested that first flowering was getting earlier: blackthorn by 0.28 days per year, hawthorn by 0.16 days per year and horse chestnut by 0.13 days per year. These rates were found to vary spatially when GWR was used and the greatest rates of change were found to be highly localized. The addition of land use change was found to improve the model fit and suggested that a 10\% increase in urban land use was also associated with phenophase advancement of 1.20 days for blackthorn, 0.57 days for hawthorn and 0.90 days for horse chestnut. When the impacts of urban land use changes was analysed using GWR, the associations with phenophase advancement were found to vary spatially, strongest associations were generally more pronounced in the north and especially in the extreme south-west and the north for all species. The results of this research suggest that the impacts of climate changes and the effects of urban land use changes on phenology vary spatially and that the impacts of urban expansion, such as UHI effects, may not be uniform. These findings suggest the need for spatially explicit analyses to quantify the local impacts and drivers of climate changes and their associated feedbacks. © 2014 Royal Meteorological Society.},

In order to compare tree growth, we sampled in total 252 small-leaved lime trees (Tilia cordata Mill) in the city of Berlin along a gradient from the city center to the surroundings. By means of increment cores, we are able to trace back their growth for the last 50 to 100 years. A general growth trend can be shown by comparing recent basal area growth with estimates from extrapolating a growth function that had been fitted with growth data from earlier years. Estimating a linear model, we show that air temperature and precipitation significantly influence tree growth within the last 20 years. Under consideration of housing density, the results reveal that higher air temperature and less precipitation led to higher growth rates in high-dense areas, but not in low-dense areas. In addition, our data reveal a significantly higher variance of the ring width index in areas with medium housing density compared to low housing density, but no temporal trend. Transferring the results to forest stands, climate change is expected to lead to higher tree growth rates.},

  abstract = {Urbanization is one of the major environmental challenges facing the world today. One of its particularly pressing effects is alterations to local and regional climate through, for example, the Urban Heat Island. Such changes in conditions are likely to have an impact on the phenology of urban vegetation, which will have knock-on implications for the role that urban green infrastructure can play in delivering multiple ecosystem services. Here, in a human-dominated region, we undertake an explicit comparison of vegetation phenology between urban and rural zones. Using satellite-derived MODIS-EVI data from the first decade of the 20th century, we extract metrics of vegetation phenology (date of start of growing season, date of end of growing season, and length of season) for Britain's 15 largest cities and their rural surrounds. On average, urban areas experienced a growing season 8.8 days longer than surrounding rural zones. As would be expected, there was a significant decline in growing season length with latitude (by 3.4 and 2.4 days/degree latitude in rural and urban areas respectively). Although there is considerable variability in how phenology in urban and rural areas differs across our study cities, we found no evidence that built urban form influences the start, end, or length of the growing season. However, the difference in the length of the growing season between rural and urban areas was significantly negatively associated with the mean disposable household income for a city. Vegetation in urban areas deliver many ecosystem services such as temperature mitigation, pollution removal, carbon uptake and storage, the provision of amenity value for humans and habitat for biodiversity. Given the rapid pace of urbanization and ongoing climate change, understanding how vegetation phenology will alter in the future is important if we wish to be able to manage urban greenspaces effectively. © 2016 Published by John Wiley \& Sons Ltd.},

  abstract = {Determining the main factors causing urban tree decline is becoming essential for sustaining their health and survival. Understanding responses of tree growth to urban environments and climate change throughout tree life span is thus necessary. To explore these questions, a dendrochronological study exploring past climate-tree growth relationships was conducted on street and park silver lindens in Paris, according to different DBH classes used as a proxy of tree age, and using climatic data for the 1970–2013 period. Younger urban silver lindens presented high sensitivity to climate with highest growth rate. In comparison with park trees, street trees had higher sensitivity to climate and lower growth rates. Climatic and pointer years analysis pointed out the importance of drought characterization in order to understand its potential impact on tree annual growth and functioning. Urban silver lindens growth is mainly and strongly correlated with precipitations and especially in autumn and spring. Finally, our study on temporal evolution between climatic factors and growth through 1970–2013 periods showed a stronger stability between growth and precipitation only in October and revealed quick climatic changes since 40 years impacting the relation between tree growth and climate. Our study highlights that an optimized irrigation management, specifically in respect of tree phenology, could contribute to maximizing silver linden functioning and survival in Paris under climate change. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

  abstract = {Results of local-scale surface energy balance observations reveal that latent heat fluxes, Qe, provided by trees are important in the surface energy control of cities. Arboreal species provide different storage latent heat, a characteristic related with the mitigation of air temperature in local-scale provided by them. The aim of this work is to compare heat fluxes in different arboreal species along the day and verify their contribution for thermal comfort inside and outside buildings. The required data are: net radiation flux density retained by sunlit and shaded layers (W/m 2) (collected by tube solarimeters), air temperature and relative humidity, atmospheric pressure and vegetation phenology (size of crown, leaves and foliar area). The measurements were carried out during the day, from sunrise to sunset, in three-day periods, throughout the year, covering different seasons. The energy balance scheme is based in the big-leaf model by Penman-Monteith (FAO056). In the research four tree species were analyzed, chosen from the most used trees in urban forestry in the South-East region of Brazil. Results showed that Qe by each trees varied between 116, 68 and 1208,89 W.h/m 2 during the year. The greatest contribution of trees for the energy balance was observed in the afternoon period. The different results obtained were due to the characteristics of the sample individual, such as structure and density of the treetop, size, shape and color of leaves, tree age and growth stage. Trees with higher tops have a good contribution in the cities, due to their energy consumption and higher solar radiation attenuation. Deciduous species are excellent in sub-tropical climate, because they can reduce heat fluxes in summer and allow them in winter. The trees around building, on streets and parks can reduce air temperature, by diminishing the conductive and convective heat gains. This effect provides thermal comfort and can reduce the energy for cooling of the buildings. These characteristics of vegetation should be taken in account by professionals of the urban built environment to improve thermal comfort outdoors, reducing the effect of heat island so ensuring better quality of life for people.},

  abstract = {Phenology is an important ecological indicator for understanding the feedback of plants to climate changes, but observation of plant phenology is not a trivial task, particularly for the large-scale areas of interest. Urban plant phenology monitoring is such a typical case, since massive residents do not necessarily mean enough eligible phenology observers. To handle this traditional challenge, this study attempted those surveillance cameras (SCs)widespread almost in any city all over the world. The schematic plan is to install an automatic software module, which has the function of plant phenology monitoring, as a plug-in into any central unit that wire-controls RGB SCs. The kernel of the module is a general-purposed algorithm capable of deriving the starting and ending dates of the key phenological events of different plants that stand in the field of view of each telecontrolled SC. The kernels of the algorithm comprise deriving phenological indices from the digital number (DN)records by a SC from all of its RGB channels and, then, modeling of plant dynamics based on the proposed novel phase-limited multi-Gaussian model for curve-fitting of phenological phases. In the case of determining the key phenological dates regarding flowering and foliation in this study, tests suggested that the proposed scheme and phenological indices and the programmed software plug-in all worked well. Overall, the feasibility of using the widespread SCs for urban plant phenology monitoring was validated, and the scheme can be further extended to composing phenology observation networks at local or global scales. The solution is of implications for more understanding the interannual rhythms of terrestrial ecosystems as well as the inherent mechanisms of vegetation-climate interactions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Hemispherical photography produces the most accurate results when working with well-exposed photographs acquired under diffuse light conditions (diffuse-light images). Obtaining such data can be prohibitively expensive when surveying hundreds of plots is required. A relatively inexpensive alternative is using photographs acquired under direct sunlight (sunlight images). However, this practice leads to high errors since the standard processing algorithms expect diffuse-light imagery. Here, instead of using classification algorithms, which is the unique dominant practice, we approached the processing of sunlight images using deep learning (DL) regression. We implemented DL systems by using the general-purpose convolutional neural networks known as VGGNet 16, VGGNet 19, Res-Net, and SE-ResNet. We trained them with 608 samples acquired in a South American temperate forest populated by Nothofagus pumilio. For their evaluation, we used 113 independent samples. Each sample (X, Y) consisted of one or several sunlight images (X), and the plant area index (PAI) and effective PAI (PAIe) extracted from a diffuse-light image (Y). The sunlight images include clear sky and broken clouds with sun elevation from 15° to 47°. We obtained the best results with the SE-ResNet architecture. The system requires a low-resolution input reprojected to cylindrical, and it can make predictions with 10\% root mean square error, even from pictures acquired with automatic exposure, which challenge previous findings. Furthermore, similar results (R2= 0.9, n = 104) can be obtained by feeding the system with photographs acquired with an inexpensive fisheye converter attached to a smartphone. Altogether, results indicate that our approach is a cost-efficient option for surveying hundreds of plots under direct sunlight. Therefore, combining our method with the traditional procedures provides processing solutions for virtually all kinds of illumination conditions. © 2020},

  abstract = {Impacts of urbanization and climate change on ecosystems are widely studied, but these drivers of change are often difficult to isolate from each other and interactions are complicated. Ecosystem responses to each of these drivers are perhaps most clearly seen in phenology changes due to global climate change (warming climate) and urbanization (heat island effect). The phenology of vegetation can influence many important ecological processes, including primary production, evapotranspiration, and plant fitness. Therefore, evaluating the interacting effects of urbanization and climate change on vegetation phenology has the potential to provide information about the long-term impact of global change. Using remotely sensed time series of vegetation on the Yangtze River Delta in China, this study evaluated the impacts of rapid urbanization and climate change on vegetation phenology along an urban to rural gradient over time. Phenology markers were extracted annually from an 18-year time series by fitting the asymmetric Gaussian function model. Thermal remote sensing acquired at daytime and nighttime was used to explore the relationship between land surface temperature and vegetation phenology. On average, the spring phenology marker was 9.6 days earlier and the autumn marker was 6.63 days later in urban areas compared with rural areas. The spring phenology of urban areas advanced and the autumn phenology delayed over time. Across space and time, warmer spring daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures were related to earlier spring, while autumn daytime and nighttime land surface temperatures were related to later autumn phenology. These results suggest that urbanization, through surface warming, compounds the effect of climate change on vegetation phenology. © 2020 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Knowledge of flowering phenology is essential for understanding the condition of forest ecosystems and responses to various anthropogenic and environmental drivers. However, monitoring the spatial and temporal variability in forest flowering at landscape scales is challenging (e.g. current monitoring is often highly localized and in-situ or for single dates). This study presents a method that combines drone and satellite images (PlanetScope) that can produce landscape-scale maps of flowering dynamics. This method is demonstrated in forest landscapes dominated by the eucalypt Corymbia calophylla (red gum or marri) in Western Australia. Drone-derived images of flowering eucalypt canopies, available for restricted temporal and spatial extents, are used to label satellite image pixels with the proportion of a pixel footprint that is flowering. The pixels labelled with flowering proportion, the response variable, are combined with various metrics that characterize time series of spectral indices sensitive to the presence of green vegetation and cream-colored flowers, the predictor variables. A machine learning model then predicts daily pixel-level flowering proportions. The model is trained with data from two sites and is tested with data from three sites and various dates throughout the Corymbia calophylla season. The model is able to accurately predict pixel-level flowering proportion throughout the flowering season (RMSE {$<$}4\% across all sites and dates), across sites with dense to sparse canopy, different background soil covers, and is robust to not detecting false positive flowering when no flowering events are occurring. Due to the spatiotemporal coverage of satellite images, this model can be deployed to generate regional maps of flowering dynamics in forest ecosystems that can be used for monitoring forest ecosystem condition and supporting research into drivers of eucalypt forest phenology.},

We developed a hierarchical classifier system that uses different feature inputs for specific classes and conducted a classification post-processing approach to improve its accuracy. From our statistical analysis of changes in urban land cover from 1987 to 2007, we conclude that built-up land areas have obviously increased, while farmland has seen in a continuous loss due to urban growth and human activities. A NDVI difference approach was used to extract information on changes in vegetation. A false change information elimination approach was developed based on prior knowledge and statistical analysis. The areas of vegetation cover have been in continuous decline over the past 20 years, although some measures have been adopted to protect and maintain urban vegetation. Given the stability of underground coal exploitation since 1990s, urban growth has become the major driving force in vegetation loss, which is different from the vegetation change driven by coal exploitation mainly before 1990. © 2010 China University of Mining and Technology.},

  abstract = {In this study, we analyze Sentinel-1 time series data to characterize the observed seasonality of different land cover classes in eastern Thuringia, Germany and to identify multi-Temporal metrics for their classification. We assess the influence of different polarizations and different pass directions on the multi-Temporal backscatter profile. The novelty of this approach is the determination of phenological parameters, based on a tool that has been originally developed for optical imagery. Furthermore, several additional multitemporal metrics are determined for the different classes, in order to investigate their separability for potential multi-Temporal classification schemes. The results of the study show a seasonality for vegetation classes, which differs depending on the considered class: whereas pastures and broad-leaved forests show a decrease of the backscatter in VH polarization during summer, an increase of the backscatter in VH polarization is observed for coniferous forest. The observed seasonality is discussed together with meteorological information (precipitation and air temperature). Furthermore, a dependence of the backscatter of the pass direction (ascending/descending) is observed particularly for the urban land cover classes. Multi-Temporal metrics indicate a good separability of principal land cover classes such as urban, agricultural and forested areas, but further investigation and use of seasonal parameters is needed for a distinct separation of specific forest sub-classes such as coniferous and deciduous. © Authors 2020.

  abstract = {Obtaining accurate tree cover maps within cities is a first step toward managing for equitable access to their ecosystem services. For example, by removing air pollutants trees contribute to fewer health impacts, and tree cover expansion could extend these benefits by targeting the most polluted areas and vulnerable populations. To support strategic tree expansion, this research created urban tree cover maps using the 2017 NASA MOD44B satellite 250 m pixel product for 35 megacities, areas with large levels of pollution and vulnerable populations. Estimates of tree cover from photo-interpretation (PI) were used to characterize map error, city-wide and from low to high tree cover, using 21 bins from 0 to 100\% tree cover. Map accuracy was highest when MOD44B percent tree cover was combined with its tree cover standard deviation product, with average difference of 1.8\% compared with PI estimates of 19.9\% city-wide tree cover. MOD44B estimates of tree cover spatial patterns had strong explanatory value. The maps explained the PI estimates of low to high tree cover at 5\% tree cover intervals with an R2 = 0.97. The Getis Ord Gi* statistic determined a non-random spatial distribution of tree cover within the megacities, with significant clustering into hot spots of relatively high tree cover and cold spots of relatively low tree cover. Tree cover hot spots were most often furthest from downtown, at the rural-urban interface or within higher elevation terrain. Tree cover cold spots were most often in areas of concentrated development and along traffic corridors known for high levels of particulate matter and other air pollutants that could be reduced by trees. Given small increases in exposure to particulate matter are associated with significant increases in death rates from viruses, and that climate change and associated heat waves are forecast to exacerbate health risks to air pollution, we need to improve global urban tree cover. These map products can be used to expand tree cover that strategically contributes to pollutant abatement, human wellbeing, and sustainable cities.},

  abstract = {Urban expansion and unprecedented rural to urban transition, along with a huge population growth, are major driving forces altering land cover/use in metropolitan areas. Many of the land cover classes such as farmlands, wetlands, forests, and bare soils have been transformed during the past years into human settlements. Identification of the city growth trends and the impact of it on the vegetation cover of an area is essential for a better understanding of the sustainability of urban development processes, both planned and unplanned. Analyzing the causes and consequences of land use dynamics helps local government, urban planners, and managers for the betterment of future plans and minimizing the negative effects. This study determined temporal changes in vegetation cover and built-up area in Istanbul (Turkey) using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil-adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), and built-up area index (BUAI). The temporal data were based on Landsat 5 Thematic Mapper (TM) images acquired in June of 1984, 2002, 2007, 2009, and 2011. The NDVI was applied to all the Landsat images, and the resulting NDVI images were overlaid to generate an NDVI layer stack image. The same procedure was repeated using the SAVI and BUAI images. The layer stack images revealed those areas that had changed in terms of the different indices over the years. To determine temporal change trends, the values of 150 randomly selected control points were extracted from the same locations in the NDVI, SAVI, and BUAI layer stack images. The results obtained from these control points showed that vegetation cover decreased considerably because of a remarkable increase in the built-up area. © 2017, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Spatially accurate and timely information on tree health is an essential component of maintaining sustainability in a species-rich urban setting. Our objective was to evaluate the potential of WorldView-3 (WV-3) satellite images from June 11th, July 30th and August 30th, 2017 to detect field-measured health condition classes of 2308 trees within the District of Columbia Department of Transportation's Street Tree Spatial Database. For each street tree in each image, we measured six vegetation indices (VIs), and find that NDVI1 (defined as the normalized ratio of the red and the first of the near infrared bands) on the July image shows the strongest statistical difference among the VI values of trees classified in the field during 2017 as in good, fair, or poor health condition. This result confirms that high spatial resolution remote sensing images provided the opportunity for a timely tree health assessment at individual tree crown level. Notably, the variability in VI attributable to health condition classes is smaller than the large declines in VIs between the June and August image dates. This greendown phenological pattern occurs similarly for trees in all health condition classes, and is thus an essential consideration when comparing VIs from different years or months for tree health assessment. The tree health condition discrimination was overwhelmed by this greendown phenology and the spectral variability in these species-rich urban settings. Based on these findings, we propose useful strategies of using these high-resolution WV-3 data for street tree health management in other cities. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH},

We classify the 19 most abundant tree species with an overall accuracy of 61.3\% and classify the ten most abundant genera with an overall accuracy of 73.7\%.

  abstract = {The ecological impact of night-time lighting is of concern because of its well demonstrated effects on animal behaviour. However, the potential of light pollution to change plant phenology and its corresponding knock-on effects on associated herbivores are less clear. Here, we test if artificial lighting can advance the timing of budburst in trees. We took a UK-wide 13 year dataset of spatially referenced budburst data from four deciduous tree species and matched it with both satellite imagery of night-time lighting and average spring temperature. We find that budburst occurs up to 7.5 days earlier in brighter areas, with the relationship being more pronounced for laterbudding species. Excluding large urban areas from the analysis showed an even more pronounced advance of budburst, confirming that the urban ‘heat-island’ effect is not the sole cause of earlier urban budburst. Similarly, the advance in budburst across all sites is too large to be explained by increases in temperature alone. This dramatic advance of budburst illustrates the need for further experimental investigation into the impact of artificial night-time lighting on plant phenology and subsequent species interactions. As light pollution is a growing global phenomenon, the findings of this study are likely to be applicable to a wide range of species interactions across the world. © 2016 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

  abstract = {Space monitoring of urban areas is based on research which uses satellite data, spatialtemporal changes of landscape and functional structure of the city and in selected indicators of the environment that are influenced by urbanization. In this paper on example of certain areas of the Kyiv metropolitan area the application of methodological issues are considered in the analysis of cosmic material changes in the landscape and the functional structure of Kyiv are associated with intense development in the valley of the Dnieper river and within the historical part. The analysis was carried out in two ways: 1) analysis of changes in the landscape and the functional structure of the city according to multispectral space imagery; 2) analysis of the distribution of surface temperatures in the historic part of the city by outer thermal scanner range The basis of the research methodology laid in our Centre processing technology space materials based on the use of so-called spectral indices and image classification with previous studies and the calculation of the underlying surface temperature according to the thermal range (10.40-12.5 microns) Landsat TM, ETM with an estimation the coefficient of a thermal radiation on normalized vegetation index (NDVI). Analysis of calculation results of temperature fields and mapping was performed using GIS. The obtained data indicates that the use of satellite data in monitoring urban landscapes can quickly track the changes of landscape and the functional structure of urban areas, identify dangerous trends in their development and monitor violations of environmental laws that can result in optimal management decisions in environmental and urban planning. Monitoring of the thermal field within the historical part of Kyiv shows that a decrease of natural land cover and sealing with urban areas increased surface heating in that area. As local microclimatic conditions, this can cause violation within protected areas and promote climate change at the regional level. The latest refers to the growth of the “urban heat island" problem, which is given very close attention in almost all developed countries. Thus, protection of vegetation and increasing its range in the historical part of Kyiv is in a priority to preserve ancient architectural ensembles. In addition, in our opinion, it is necessary to introduce the European countries experience for the construction buildings with “green roofs” that reduce the negative impact of high temperature in an urban environment in summer and reduce heat and energy losses in the winter © SGEM2014.},

  abstract = {In this paper we extensively describe new software available as a R package that allows for the extraction of phenological information from time-lapse digital photography of vegetation cover. The phenopix R package includes all steps in data processing. It enables the user to: draw a region of interest (ROI) on an image; extract red green and blue digital numbers (DN) from a seasonal series of images; depict greenness index trajectories; fit a curve to the seasonal trajectories; extract relevant phenological thresholds (phenophases); extract phenophase uncertainties. The software capabilities are illustrated by analyzing one year of data from a selection of seven sites belonging to the PhenoCam network (http://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/), including an unmanaged subalpine grassland, a tropical grassland, a deciduous needle-leaf forest, three deciduous broad-leaf temperate forests and an evergreen needle-leaf forest. One of the novelties introduced by the package is the spatially explicit, pixel-based analysis, which potentially allows to extract within-ecosystem or within-individual variability of phenology. We examine the relationship between phenophases extracted by the traditional ROI-averaged and the novel pixel-based approaches, and further illustrate potential applications of pixel-based image analysis available in the phenopix R package.},

  abstract = {Plants and vegetation play a critical—but largely unpredictable—role in global environmental changes due to the multitude of contributing processes at widely different spatial and temporal scales. In this Perspective, we explore approaches to master this complexity and improve our ability to predict vegetation dynamics by explicitly taking account of principles that constrain plant and ecosystem behaviour: natural selection, self-organization and entropy maximization. These ideas are increasingly being used in vegetation models, but we argue that their full potential has yet to be realized. We demonstrate the power of natural selection-based optimality principles to predict photosynthetic and carbon allocation responses to multiple environmental drivers, as well as how individual plasticity leads to the predictable self-organization of forest canopies. We show how models of natural selection acting on a few key traits can generate realistic plant communities and how entropy maximization can identify the most probable outcomes of community dynamics in space- and time-varying environments. Finally, we present a roadmap indicating how these principles could be combined in a new generation of models with stronger theoretical foundations and an improved capacity to predict complex vegetation responses to environmental change.},

Switzerland has one of the longest pollen time series now – more than half a century. It has been tested whether the impact of climate change is robust by checking with this long time series of different pollen like hazel, birch, and grass as prominent representatives of triggers of hay fever. The results indicate that based on a time series of 50 years, the pollen seasons of hazel, birch, and grass started earlier as the temperature increased. Comparing the annual amount of pollen, a relevant increase is only observed for hazel. However, it must be considered that in the observed 50 years there was a land use change from grass land to built-up land due to the increase of population, and yet certain pollen counts increased considerably.},

  abstract = {Previous studies of urbanization have largely focused on the irreversible urban growth process and the conversion of non-urban lands into impervious surfaces, but less on the conversion from impervious surfaces to green space, also referred to as deurbanization. However, urbanization and deurbanization are both typical urban renewal process, which may happen simultaneously during the urban renewal. In this study, we proposed a new method to retrieve and map annual impervious surface percentage (ISP) and to characterize urban growth patterns using time series medium- resolution images. The method is implemented by employing the Cubist tree model for annual ISP inversion (AoCubist), optimizing multi-temporal Landsat composite images to minimize the impact of phenology and inter-year climate variation, and developing the C5.0 decision tree algorithm with temporal-spatial filtering rules to improve the space-time continuity and separability of patterns derived by unsupervised K-means classification. The method was applied to investigate the urban renewal in Guangzhou, China, between 2000 and 2010. The results demonstrate that the use of ISP slope series can capture the spatial variations and temporal trends of urban growth. Validation by fieldwork and comparing with Google Earth imagery indicates that our classification yielded a reasonable overall accuracy, ranging from 88.32\% to 90.85\%. Annual urban expansion rate remained between 4\% and 10\%, while annual deurbanization rate varied from 1\% to 5\%. In addition, the total pixels of rapid deurbanization surpassed that of rapid urban expansion. This finding suggests that various change directions occurred in the urban renewal process and that deurbanization was a way to counter-balance the rapid urbanization. This study provides a solid methodology for ISP change detection and fresh insight into the characteristics of urban growth in terms of timing, duration, and magnitude. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Climate change forecasts higher temperatures in urban environments worsening the urban heat island effect (UHI). Green infrastructure (GI) in cities could reduce the UHI by regulating and reducing ambient temperatures. Forest cities (i.e., Melbourne, Australia) aimed for large-scale planting of trees to adapt to climate change in the next decade. Therefore, monitoring cities\&rsquo; green infrastructure requires close assessment of growth and water status at the tree-by-tree resolution for its proper maintenance and needs to be automated and efficient. This project proposed a novel monitoring system using an integrated visible and infrared thermal camera mounted on top of moving vehicles. Automated computer vision algorithms were used to analyze data gathered at an Elm trees avenue in the city of Melbourne, Australia (n = 172 trees) to obtain tree growth in the form of effective leaf area index (LAIe) and tree water stress index (TWSI), among other parameters. Results showed the tree-by-tree variation of trees monitored (5.04 km) between 2016\&ndash;2017. The growth and water stress parameters obtained were mapped using customized codes and corresponded with weather trends and urban management. The proposed urban tree monitoring system could be a useful tool for city planning and GI monitoring, which can graphically show the diurnal, spatial, and temporal patterns of change of LAIe and TWSI to monitor the effects of climate change on the GI of cities.},

AbstractTrees in urban environments are exposed to heat stress, low air humidity and soil drought. The increasing temperatures and the more frequent heat and drought events will intensify the stress level of urban trees. We applied a dendrochronological approach to evaluate the species-specific suitability under increasing risk of drought of five tree species at highly sealed urban sites in the city of Dresden (Germany). Climate-growth correlation analyses show that temperatures and water availability from April to July in the current year and in summer and autumn of the previous year are the main determining factors for radial growth. However, distinct species-specific differences were found in the response to temperature, precipitation and the self-calibrated Palmer Drought Severity Index. During the study period, the influence of temperature and drought on radial growth during summer months increases for Acer platanoides and Acer pseudoplatanus, whereas no changes occurred for Quercus petraea, Quercus rubra, and P. × hispanica. Pointer year analysis and superposed epoch analyses revealed a species-specific response to extreme climatic events. While for A. platanoides and A. pseudoplatanus a higher number of negative pointer years and significant growth declines in drought years were found, Q. petraea and Q. rubra showed more frequent positive pointer years but no significant growth reductions during drought. Based on these response patterns we classified the studied tree species according to their suitability and drought tolerance for urban sites.},

  abstract = {Vegetation and trees in particular play a key role in mitigating thermal load in urban areas. The goals of this study were to analyse species-specific microclimatic effects and to identify the role of leaf-area-density, transpiration, and stomatal conductance for cooling effects at urban sites. Air temperature, relative humidity and surface temperature were used to study the effects of six tree species with similar age structure in a residential area with comparable site conditions. Transpiration, stomatal conductance and leaf-area density were measured during the summer months in 2013. Air temperatures and relative humidity were monitored for four trees per street in hourly intervals, and surface temperatures were recorded in the afternoon for three hot days on the shaded and unshaded asphalt surfaces beneath the trees. Species differ significantly in their ability to reduce air and surface temperatures, as well as to increase relative humidity. Trees showing both a high leaf-area density and a high rate of transpiration are more effective in cooling the air temperatures. Differences in the surface temperatures of the tree shaded areas are more pronounced compared to the air temperatures. Thus, the surface temperatures of the full sun exposed areas are up to 15.2K warmer than that in the tree shaded areas. The results provide information to decrease thermal load in urban areas for future tree planting by choosing species with high cooling potential. The highest cooling potential was measured for Corylus colurna and Tilia cordata ‘Greenspire’ and the lowest for Ulmus × hollandica ‘Lobel’.},

  abstract = {Plant phenology is highly sensitive to changes in environmental conditions and can vary widely across landscapes. Current observation methods are either manual for small-scale, high precision measurements or by satellite remote sensing for large-scale, low spatial resolution measurement. The development of inexpensive approaches is necessary to advance large scale, high precision phenology monitoring. The use of publicly available, Internet-connected cameras, often associated with airports, national parks, and roadway conditions, for detecting and monitoring plant phenology at a continental scale can augment existing ground and satellite-based methodologies. We collected twice-daily images from over 1100 georeferenced public cameras across North America from February 2008 to 2009. Using a test subset of these cameras, we compared modeled spring ‘green-up’ with that from co-occurring remote sensing products. Although varying image exposure and color correction introduced noise to camera measurements, we were able to correlate spring green-up across North America with visual validation from images and detect a latitudinal trend. Public cameras had an equivalent or higher ability to detect spring compared with satellite-based data for corresponding locations, with fewer numbers of poor quality days, shorter continuous bad data days, and significantly lower errors of spring estimates. Manual image segmentation into deciduous, evergreen, and understory vegetation allowed detection of spring and fall onset for multiple vegetation types. Additional advantages of a public camera-based monitoring system include frequent image capture (subdaily) and the potential to detect quantitative responses to environmental changes in organisms, species, and communities. Public cameras represent a relatively untapped and freely available resource for supporting large-scale ecological and environmental monitoring.},

  abstract = {This article presents a novel methodology for the characterization of tree vegetation phenology, based on vegetation indices time series reconstruction and adapted to urban areas. The methodology is based on a pixel by pixel curve fitting classification, together with a subsequent Savitzky-Golay filtering of raw phenological curves from pixels classified as vegetation. Moreover, the new method is conceived to face specificities of urban environments such as: the high heterogeneity of impervious/natural elements, the 3D structure of the city inducing shadows, the restricted spatial extent of individual tree crowns and the strong biodiversity of urban vegetation. Three vegetation indices have been studied: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Normalized Difference Red Edge Index 1 (NDRE1), which are mainly linked to chlorophyll content and leaf density and Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) mostly correlated to water content and leaf density. The methodology has been designed to allow the analysis of annual and intra-annual vegetation phenological dynamics. Then, different annual and intra-annual criteria for phenology characterization are proposed and criticized. To show the applicability of the methodology, this article focuses on Sentinel-2 (S-2) imagery covering 2018 and the study of groups of London planes in an alignment structure in the French city of Toulouse. Results showed that the new method allows the ability to (1) describe the heterogeneity of phenologies from London planes exposed to different environmental conditions (urban canyons, proximity with a source of water) and (2) to detect intra-annual phenological dynamics linked to changes in meteorological conditions. © 2020 by the author.},

  abstract = {Recent decades have been characterized by increasing temperatures worldwide, resulting in an exponential climb in vapor pressure deficit (VPD). VPD has been identified as an increasingly important driver of plant functioning in terrestrial biomes and has been established as a major contributor in recent drought-induced plant mortality independent of other drivers associated with climate change. Despite this, few studies have isolated the physiological response of plant functioning to high VPD, thus limiting our understanding and ability to predict future impacts on terrestrial ecosystems. An abundance of evidence suggests that stomatal conductance declines under high VPD and transpiration increases in most species up until a given VPD threshold, leading to a cascade of subsequent impacts including reduced photosynthesis and growth, and higher risks of carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Incorporation of photosynthetic and hydraulic traits in ‘next-generation’ land-surface models has the greatest potential for improved prediction of VPD responses at the plant- and global-scale, and will yield more mechanistic simulations of plant responses to a changing climate. By providing a fully integrated framework and evaluation of the impacts of high VPD on plant function, improvements in forecasting and long-term projections of climate impacts can be made.},

Compared to open spaces/landscapes the complex surface structure of urban areas creates an environment with special microclimatic characteristics, which have a dominant effect on the energy balance of the human body. In this study, outdoor thermal comfort conditions are examined through two field-surveys in Szeged, a South-Hungarian city (population 160,000). The intensity of radiation fluxes is dependent on several factors, such as surface structure and housing density. Since our sample area is located in a heavily built-up city centre, radiation fluxes are mainly influenced by narrow streets and several 20–30-year-old (20–30m tall) trees. Special emphasis is given to the human-biometeorological assessment of the microclimate of complex urban environments through the application of the thermal index PET. The analysis is carried out by the utilization of the RayMan model. Firstly, bioclimatic conditions of sites located close to each other but shaded differently by buildings and plants are compared. The results show that differences in the PET index amongst these places can be as high as 15–20∘C due to the different irradiation. Secondly, the investigation of different modelled environments by RayMan (only buildings, buildings+trees and only trees) shows significant alterations in the human comfort sensation between the situations.},

  abstract = {Based on the time series NDVI images from 1998 to 2005 and by the method of moving average, the vegetation phenology in urban areas and buffer zones of Shanghai, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi and Suzhou in Yangtze River Delta region were calculated. The difference of average phenology in urban areas and buffer zones was analyzed, and the relationship between this difference and the distance away from urban edge was studied. The results showed that in 1998 -2005, the urbanization of the cities made the vegetations in their urban area had an earlier start of growing season (SOS), later end of growing season (EOS), longer growing season length (GSL), and smaller NDVIamp (difference of maximal and minimal NDVI in a year). These changes were more obvious in buffer zones if they were closer to urban area. In general, urbanization made the SOS within 4 kilometers away from the urban edge started obviously earlier, and the EOS, GSL and NDVIamp within 10 kilometers away from the urban edge changed obviously. The differences of GSL between urban and buffer zones had a significant logarithmic relationship with the distance away from the urban edge, so did the NDVIamp.},

  abstract = {Analysing the climate envelope of plant species has been suggested as a tool to predict the vulnerability of tree species in future urban climates. However, there is little evidence that the climate envelope of a plant species directly relates to the drought and thermal tolerance of that species, at least not at the resolution required to identify or rank species vulnerability. Here, we attempted to predict drought and thermal tolerance of commonly used urban tree species using climate variables derived exclusively from open-source global occurrence data. We quantified three drought and thermal tolerance traits for 43 urban tree species in a common garden experiment: stomatal sensitivity to vapour pressure deficit, leaf water potential at the turgor loss point, and leaf thermal tolerance. We then attempted to predict each tolerance trait from variables derived from the climate envelope of each species, using occurrence data from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. We found no strong relationships between drought and thermal tolerance traits and climatic variables. Across wide environmental gradients, plant tolerance and climate are inherently linked. But our results suggest that climate envelopes determined from species occurrence data alone may not predict drought or thermal tolerance at the resolution required to select tree species for future urban forests. We should focus on identifying the most relevant strategies and traits required to describe tolerance which in combination with climate envelope analysis should ultimately predict growth and mortality of trees in urban landscapes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Little information is known about the effects of climate warming on phenology of urban tree species in the northern forest of China. In this study, we investigated the phenological characteristics of the main tree species in the urban forest of Shengyang City in China and the correlation between phenology and atmospheric temperature from the discontinuous data during past 42 years over three time periods (from 1962 to 1965, 1977 to 1978, and 2000 to 2005). The results showed that the annual average temperature in Shenyang City showed an increasing trend and increased by 0.96°C from 1962 to 2005 due to climate warming. The germination phenology of the urban trees was negatively correlated with the temperature in winter and early spring. The leafing phenology was mainly influenced by the temperature in spring before leafing. Influenced by climate warming, the germination, leafing, and flowering phenologies of this urban forest in 2005 were 14, 13, and 10 days earlier than those in 1962, respectively. We inferred that further warming in winter might prolong the growing season of urban trees in the northern forest of China. © 2016, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agricultural Ecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

  abstract = {In an urban context, tree data are used in city planning, in locating hazardous trees and in environmental monitoring. This study focuses on developing an innovative methodology to automatically estimate the most relevant individual structural parameters of urban trees sampled by a Mobile LiDAR System at city level. These parameters include the Diameter at Breast Height (DBH), which was estimated by circle fitting of the points belonging to different height bins using RANSAC. In the case of non-circular trees, DBH is calculated by the maximum distance between extreme points. Tree sizes were extracted through a connectivity analysis. Crown Base Height, defined as the length until the bottom of the live crown, was calculated by voxelization techniques. For estimating Canopy Volume, procedures of mesh generation and α-shape methods were implemented. Also, tree location coordinates were obtained by means of Principal Component Analysis. The workflow has been validated on 29 trees of different species sampling a stretch of road 750 m long in Delft (The Netherlands) and tested on a larger dataset containing 58 individual trees. The validation was done against field measurements. DBH parameter had a correlation R2 value of 0.92 for the height bin of 20 cm which provided the best results. Moreover, the influence of the number of points used for DBH estimation, considering different height bins, was investigated. The assessment of the other inventory parameters yield correlation coefficients higher than 0.91. The quality of the results confirms the feasibility of the proposed methodology, providing scalability to a comprehensive analysis of urban trees.},

  abstract = {Background:Despite the recent developments in physically and chemically based analysis of atmospheric particles, no models exist for resolving the spatial variability of pollen concentration at urban scale.Objectives:We developed a land use regression (LUR) approach for predicting spatial fine-scale allergenic pollen concentrations in the Helsinki metropolitan area, Finland, and evaluated the performance of the models against available empirical data.Methods:We used grass pollen data monitored at 16 sites in an urban area during the peak pollen season and geospatial environmental data. The main statistical method was generalized linear model (GLM).Results:GLM-based LURs explained 79\% of the spatial variation in the grass pollen data based on all samples, and 47\% of the variation when samples from two sites with very high concentrations were excluded. In model evaluation, prediction errors ranged from 6\% to 26\% of the observed range of grass pollen concentrations. Our findings support the use of geospatial data–based statistical models to predict the spatial variation of allergenic grass pollen concentrations at intra-urban scales. A remote sensing–based vegetation index was the strongest predictor of pollen concentrations for exposure assessments at local scales.Conclusions:The LUR approach provides new opportunities to estimate the relations between environmental determinants and allergenic pollen concentration in human-modified environments at fine spatial scales. This approach could potentially be applied to estimate retrospectively pollen concentrations to be used for long-term exposure assessments.Citation:Hjort J, Hugg TT, Antikainen H, Rusanen J, Sofiev M, Kukkonen J, Jaakkola MS, Jaakkola JJ. 2016.

As the representation of human activities, urbanization affects vegetation phenology by changing the local climate such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc. Recent studies starts to focus on the impacts of urbanization intensity on phenology. In order to understand the relationship between urbanization intensity and phenology, we identified the phenological transitional dates based on NDVI from SPOT/VGT and used a eveloped urban index ranges from 0-1 to represent intensity of urbanization using data from Defense Satellite Meteorological Program - Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS). The relationship between urban index and phenological transition dates from 1999 to 2002 were analyzed. It is found that there's a not-so significant linear relationship between urban index and phenological transitional dates anomaly. However, when the excluded the biophysical factors, the local climatic variation is the key factor determining the phenology anomaly, while urbanization level also has influence on it.},

  abstract = {It is important to grasp the number and location of trees, and measure tree structure attributes, such as tree trunk diameter and height. The accurate measurement of these parameters will lead to efficient forest resource utilization, maintenance of trees in urban cities, and feasible afforestation planning in the future. Recently, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) has been receiving considerable attention, compared with conventional manual measurement techniques. However, it is difficult to use LiDAR for widespread applications, mainly because of the costs. We propose a method for tree measurement using 360\&deg; spherical cameras, which takes omnidirectional images. For the structural measurement, the three-dimensional (3D) images were reconstructed using a photogrammetric approach called structure from motion. Moreover, an automatic tree detection method from the 3D images was presented. First, the trees included in the 360\&deg; spherical images were detected using YOLO v2. Then, these trees were detected with the tree information obtained from the 3D images reconstructed using structure from motion algorithm. As a result, the trunk diameter and height could be accurately estimated from the 3D images. The tree detection model had an F-measure value of 0.94. This method could automatically estimate some of the structural parameters of trees and contribute to more efficient tree measurement.},

  abstract = {Due to the intensity of urban development around the world, there is an increasing body of studies attempting to investigate urban heat island (UHI) in various spatial and temporal scales. In surface heat urban island (SUHI) studies, extended periods of time, broader regions and local government area (LGA) level have become more crucial and will shed light on causes of UHI. Moreover, the spatial pattern and structure of SUHI will be useful for policy-makers to develop mitigation strategies. This study focused on three objectives. Firstly, analyzing land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference built-up (NDBI) and vegetation (NDVI) indices. Secondly, investigating interrelationships among LST, NDVI, and NDBI. Thirdly, identifying LST patterns in the Melbourne metropolitan area. These objectives were achieved through three different methods. The modified automatic mapping method for the first objective, the correlation analysis for the second, and spatial statistical methods for the third. The methodological innovations of this study were considering LGA in interrelationship analysis among LST, NDBI and NDVI, and calculation of NDVI for each acquisition date. The results indicated that the clustering pattern of LST expanded toward the north-west and south-east during the period of the study. Furthermore, the north-west part of the city has the highest positive (0.6) correlation between NDBI and LST, and the south-east part of the city has the lowest negative (−0.8) correlation between NDVI and LST. The most significant increase and decrease in mean LST happened respectively from January 6th to 22nd 2017, and January 14th to 30th January 2014. The temperature degree altered from 19.61 °C to 27.86 °C in inner western suburbs, and from 35.49 °C to 26.88 °C in most LGA's. These findings are critical for planners to localize UHI mitigation action plans, target hot spots in LGA's and allocate resources to respond to the adverse effect of UHI. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Urbanization exerts anthropogenic forcing that affects regional climate and ecosystems. With increasing levels of urbanization associated with urban population growth in the near future, understanding of the impact of urbanization on terrestrial ecosystems is important for predicting future environmental changes. This study evaluates the impact of urbanization on spring and autumn phenology by addressing the relationship between population density and phenology at nine stations in the Seoul Capital Area (SCA), South Korea during 1991–2010. We analyze the spring budburst dates for the six species (Prunus mume, Forsythia koreana, Rhododendron mucronulatum, Prunus yedoensis, Prunus persica, and Prunus pyrifolia) and the leaf coloring date for the two species (Ginkgo biloba and Acer palmatum). Regardless of species, the density of the urban population shows significant negative (positive) relationships with spring (autumn) phenology. In the SCA, urban population increases are related to earlier spring budburst up to 13 days and delayed leaf coloring up to 15 days. The most apparent spring budburst sensitivity is observed in Prunus mume, whereas the most dominant autumn leaf coloring sensitivity is observed in Acer palmatum. The relationship between population density and phenology is supported by the difference in nocturnal temperatures between stations which varies with the population density. Our results suggest that, in addition to global warming, future population growth should be considered in ecosystem assessments of human-induced environmental changes. © 2018, ISB.},

  abstract = {Cities are natural laboratories for studying vegetation responses to global environmental changes because of their climate, atmospheric, and biogeochemical conditions. However, few holistic studies have been conducted on the impact of urbanization on vegetation growth. We decomposed the overall impacts of urbanization on vegetation growth into direct (replacement of original land surfaces by impervious built-up) and indirect (urban environments) components, using a conceptual framework and remotely sensed data for 377 metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in the conterminous United States (CONUS) in 2001, 2006, and 2011. Results showed that urban pixels are often greener than expected given the amount of paved surface they contain. The vegetation growth enhancement due to indirect effects occurred in 88.4\%, 90.8\%, and 92.9\% of urban bins in 2001, 2006, and 2011, respectively. By defining offset value as the ratio of the absolute indirect and direct impact, we obtained that growth enhancement due to indirect effects compensated for about 29.2\%, 29.5\%, and 31.0\% of the reduced productivity due to loss of vegetated surface area on average in 2001, 2006, and 2011, respectively. Vegetation growth responses to urbanization showed little temporal variation but large regional differences with higher offset value in the western CONUS than in the eastern CONUS. Our study highlights the prevalence of vegetation growth enhancement in urban environments and the necessity of differentiating various impacts of urbanization on vegetation growth, and calls for tailored field experiments to understand the relative contributions of various driving forces to vegetation growth and predict vegetation responses to future global change using cities as harbingers.},

  abstract = {Canopy phenology is sensitive to variability in local environmental settings. In temperate climates, urban phenological processes and their determinants are relatively well understood. Equivalent understanding of processes in tropical urban settings is, however, less resolved. In this paper, we explore the influence of local urban environmental characteristics (that is, degree of urbanization, land cover and urban climate) on canopy phenology of two deciduous tree species (Jacaranda mimosifolia, n = 48, and Tabebuia rosea, n = 24) in a tropical city (Kampala, Uganda). Our study design involved ground monitoring and field sampling in 2017, with a focus on the dry season. We found that both species experienced significantly higher rates of canopy cover decline in heavily built-up neighborhoods (p ¡ 0.05 for both species). Moreover, Jacaranda was more sensitive to differences in the degree of urbanization than Tabebuia, both in terms of total percentage tree canopy cover (p ¡ 0.01) and net leaf loss (p ¡ 0.05). Total percentage tree canopy cover for Jacaranda declined with increasing proportion of impervious cover (that is, roads and paved cover) and was positively related to relative humidity (p ¡ 0.01), a variable correlated with soil moisture. Net leaf loss in Jacaranda increased with the decreasing proportion of pervious land cover and as nighttime air temperature increased (p ¡ 0.01). In contrast, land cover and urban climate had no significant influence on either measure of phenological traits for Tabebuia. These results provide new evidence of the effect of urbanization on canopy phenology of different tree species in the tropics. Such knowledge offers new insights into the spatial and temporal differences in the physiological functional traits of trees and also serves as a proxy for possible species responses under future climate change. © 2020, The Author(s).},

However, in contrast to temperate cites, there is little evidence to show how UHI influences landscape phenological processes in the tropics. In this study, we examined vegetation phenological responses to urban form, distance from the city centre and surface temperatures, in the tropical city of Kampala, Uganda. Estimates of vegetation growing season length and land surface temperature were derived from MODIS satellite imagery for multiple years (2013–2015) and urban form was characterised using the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) classification. We showed that growing season length increased along the urban–rural gradient (p ¡ 0.001) and was longest in the least built-up LCZ class (p ¡ 0.001). Growing season length was significantly reduced as land surface temperature increased (p ¡ 0.001). These findings contrast with results reported for temperate cities, where higher temperatures are often associated with longer vegetation growing seasons. Our findings suggest that enhanced surface temperatures associated with UHI are a limiting factor to season length in the urban tropics. Urban planners in tropical cities should therefore account for vegetation sensitivity to UHI when developing targeted management strategies aiming to optimise the benefits accrued from vegetation. © 2020 The Author(s)},

  abstract = {Accurate and reliable land use/land cover (LULC) information obtained by remote sensing technology is necessary in many applications such as environmental monitoring, agricultural management, urban planning, hydrological applications, soil management, vegetation condition study and suitability analysis. But this information still remains a challenge especially in heterogeneous landscapes covering urban and rural areas due to spectrally similar LULC features. In parallel with technological developments, supplementary data such as satellite-derived spectral indices have begun to be used as additional bands in classification to produce data with high accuracy. The aim of this research is to test the potential of spectral vegetation indices combination with supervised classification methods and to extract reliable LULC information from SPOT 7 multispectral imagery. The Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Ratio Vegetation Index (RATIO), the Soil Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) were the three vegetation indices used in this study. The classical maximum likelihood classifier (MLC) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm were applied to classify SPOT 7 image. Catalca is selected region located in the north west of the Istanbul in Turkey, which has complex landscape covering artificial surface, forest and natural area, agricultural field, quarry/mining area, pasture/scrubland and water body. Accuracy assessment of all classified images was performed through overall accuracy and kappa coefficient. The results indicated that the incorporation of these three different vegetation indices decrease the classification accuracy for the MLC and SVM classification. In addition, the maximum likelihood classification slightly outperformed the support vector machine classification approach in both overall accuracy and kappa statistics. © Authors 2017.},

  abstract = {Temperature gradients in cities can cause inter-neighborhood differences in the timing of pollen release. However, most epidemiological studies examining allergenic pollen utilize daily measurements from a single pollen monitoring station with the implicit assumption that the measured time series of airborne pollen concentrations applies across the study areas, and that the temporal mismatch between concentrations at the counting station and elsewhere in the study area is negligible. This assumption is tested by quantifying temperature using satellite imagery, observing flowering times of oak (Quercus) and mulberry (Morus) trees at multiple sites, and collecting airborne pollen. Epidemiological studies of allergenic pollen are reviewed and temperatures within their study areas are quantified. In this one-year study, peak oak flowering time was well explained by average February nighttime temperature (R 2 = 0.94), which varied by 6 °C across Detroit. This relationship was used to predict flowering phenology across the study region. Peak flowering ranged from April 20–May 13 and predicted a substantial portion of relative airborne oak pollen concentrations in Detroit (R 2 = 0.46) and at the regional pollen monitoring station (R 2 = 0.61). The regional pollen monitoring station was located in a cooler outlying area where peak flowering occurred around May 12 and peak pollen concentrations were measured on May 15. This provides evidence that the timing of pollen release varies substantially within a metropolitan area and challenges the assumption that pollen measurements at a single location are representative of an entire city. Across the epidemiological studies, 50\% of study areas were not within 1 °C (equal to a lag or lead of 4 days in flowering time) of temperatures at the pollen measurement location. Epidemiological studies using a single pollen station as a proxy for pollen concentrations are prone to significant measurement error if the study area is climatically variable. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Epidemiological analyses of airborne allergenic pollen often use concentration measurements from a single station to represent exposure across a city, but this approach does not account for the spatial variation of concentrations within the city. Because there are few descriptions of urban-scale variation, the resulting exposure measurement error is unknown but potentially important for epidemiological studies. This study examines urban-scale variation in pollen concentrations by measuring pollen concentrations of 13 taxa over 24-h periods twice weekly at 25 sites in two seasons in Detroit, Michigan. Spatiotemporal variation is described using cumulative distribution functions and regression models. Daily pollen concentrations across the 25 stations varied considerably, and the average quartile coefficient of dispersion was 0.63. Measurements at a single site explained 3–85\% of the variation at other sites, depending on the taxon, and 95\% prediction intervals of pollen concentrations generally spanned one to two orders of magnitude. These results demonstrate considerable heterogeneity of pollen levels at the urban scale and suggest that the use of a single monitoring site will not reflect pollen exposure over an urban area and can lead to sizable measurement error in epidemiological studies, particularly when a daily time step is used. These errors might be reduced by using predictive daily pollen levels in models that combine vegetation maps, pollen production estimates, phenology models, and dispersion processes, or by using coarser time steps in the epidemiological analysis.},

  abstract = {Many plant phenological events are sensitive to temperature, leading to changes in the seasonal cycle of ecosystem function as the climate warms. To evaluate the current and future implications of temperature changes for plant phenology, researchers commonly use a metric of temperature sensitivity, which quantifies the change in phenology per degree change in temperature. Here, we examine the temperature sensitivity of phenology, and highlight conditions under which the widely used days-per-degree sensitivity approach is subject to methodological issues that can generate misleading results. We identify several factors, in particular the length of the period over which temperature is integrated, and changes in the statistical characteristics of the integrated temperature, that can affect the estimated apparent sensitivity to temperature. We show how the resulting artifacts can lead to spurious differences in apparent temperature sensitivity and artificial spatial gradients. Such issues are rarely considered in analyses of the temperature sensitivity of phenology. Given the issues identified, we advocate for process-oriented modelling approaches, informed by observations and with fully characterised uncertainties, as a more robust alternative to the simple days-per-degree temperature sensitivity metric. We also suggest approaches to minimise and assess spurious influences in the days-per-degree metric.},

  abstract = {Urban overheating coincides with Heatwaves (HWs) and the thermal stress might get amplified in cities. To predict the interactions between urban overheating and HWs, the surface energy balance response to HWs is crucial. HW is a regional phenomenon and the climatic conditions may influence the local conditions to alter the energy budget contrast between a city and its adjacent peripheral areas. The interactions between the urban overheating and HWs are explored in a coastal city (Sydney Australia), also in the proximity of dry landmass, while considering the site characteristics, distance from the coast, and the population density. A positive response between urban overheating and HWs is reported. Advective heat flux in the form of a dualistic circulation system is found responsible for exacerbating the urban overheating magnitude (ΔT) during the HWs and altering the available energy balance. Land-coastal distance is also found as an important contributor in magnifying the urban-suburban temperature contrast. Considering the future urbanization in western Sydney, surfaces capable of retaining higher moisture content are prescribed to reduce the occurrence of extreme HW events. Activation of the ventilation corridor for the coastal wind penetration in western Sydney is another recommendation of this study. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Invasive alien plants are considered a major driver of global biodiversity loss. Therefore, there is a huge demand of spatial and temporal data on their distribution for investigating possible drivers of species invasions and for predictions of future distributions. We use Google Street View imagery (GSV) as a new source of spatial and temporal data. GSV provides millions of panoramic views along road networks worldwide allowing for the identification of many plant species, including invasive ones. Thus, GSV has a great potential to support ecological research in documenting species distribution, but reliable validation of its precision and accuracy is lacking. Here, we describe and evaluate an approach using GSV to visually track the spread of invasive alien plants, the North American goldenrods (Solidago canadensis and S. gigantea) occurring abundantly along road network in Poland (Central Europe). We determined presence/absence of the species along 160 randomly selected transects of a length of 500 m by visual inspection of GSV images and compared it with field surveys at the same transects. We show that the occurrence of goldenrods in GSV is a reliable predictor of their occurrence in the wild. Sampling parameters, like road width, season when GSV pictures were taken and number of months elapsed since taking the GSV pictures, did not change the correlation between outputs of the two methods (GSV and field sampling). Furthermore, both the occurrence of goldenrods observed in the field and their occurrence in GSV have similar relations to habitat characteristics investigated (the same direction of relationship and similar effect size). We suggest Google Street View images may be an additional tool to be used in the detection and tracking of the spread of invasive alien plants along roadsides. The approach may be useful in assessing temporal changes in roadside vegetation and managing problematic plant species across large spatial scales and may contribute to the further development of more efficient sampling methods in ecological studies. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Urban areas alter local atmospheric conditions by modifying surface albedo and consequently the surface radiation and energy balances, releasing waste heat from anthropogenic uses, and increasing atmospheric aerosols, all of which combine to increase temperatures in cities, especially overnight, compared with surrounding rural areas, resulting in a phenomenon called the "urban heat island" effect. Recent rapid urbanization of the planet has generated calls for remote sensing research related to the impacts of urban areas and urbanization on the natural environment. Spatially extensive, high spatial resolution data products are needed to capture phenological patterns in regions with heterogeneous land cover and external drivers such as cities, which are comprised of a mixture of land cover/land uses and experience microclimatic influences. Here we use the 30 m normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) product from the Web-Enabled Landsat Data (WELD) project to analyze the impacts of urban areas and their surface heat islands on the seasonal development of the vegetated land surface along an urban-rural gradient for 19 cities located in the Upper Midwest of the United States. We fit NDVI observations from 2003-2012 as a quadratic function of thermal time as accumulated growing degree-days (AGDD) calculated from the Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) 1 km land surface temperature product to model decadal land surface phenology metrics at 30 m spatial resolution. In general, duration of growing season (measured in AGDD) in green core areas is equivalent to duration of growing season in urban extent areas, but significantly longer than duration of growing season in areas outside of the urban extent. We found an exponential relationship in the difference of duration of growing season between urban and surrounding rural areas as a function of distance from urban core areas for perennial vegetation, with an average magnitude of 669 AGDD (base 0 C) and the influence of urban areas extending greater than 11 km from urban core areas. At the regional scale, relative change in duration of growing season does not appear to be significantly related to total area of urban extent, population, or latitude. The distance and magnitude that urban areas exert influence on vegetation in and near cities is relatively uniform. © 2017 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Monitoring short temporal changes in intra-urban vegetation areas will become very important as the proportion of urban areas continue to increase. Intra-urban variations in vegetation abundance influence environmental conditions by selective reflection and absorption of solar radiation and by sequestration of pollutants. This research investigates the hypothesis that it should be possible to use easily accessible multispectral Landsat 8 images to track intra-urban vegetation, and obtaining sufficient quality information about short temporal changes, in the town of Zagreb (Croatia). In situ measurements have not been performed. The article presents only the results of remote sensing methods based on multi-temporal Landsat 8 satellite imagery. These results are the following vegetation indices: Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Green-Red Vegetation Index (GRVI) and Ratio Vegetation Index (RVI), calculated on the basis of the channels of the mentioned satellite system. The conditions of vegetation have been observed in three seasons: spring (April), summer (August) and autumn (October) in 2016 and 2017. In the focus area there is mostly deciduous vegetation (forest), which is why the conditions of vegetation have not been observed in winter months. The values of vegetation indices were used to extract information on changes in vegetation and this analysis are represented in this article. Further studies should include foresters in order to make a more meaningful interpretation of the results. © SGEM2019. All Rights Reserved.},

  abstract = {The visibility of natural greenness is associated with several health benefits along multiple pathways, including stress recovery and attention restoration mechanisms. However, existing methodologies are inadequate for capturing eye-level greenness visibility exposure at high spatial resolutions for observers located on the ground. As a response, we developed an innovative methodological approach to model and map eye-level greenness visibility exposure for 5 m interval locations within a large study area. We used multi-source spatial data and applied viewshed analysis in conjunction with a distance decay model to compute a novel Viewshed Greenness Visibility Index (VGVI) at more than 86 million observer locations. We compared our eye-level visibility exposure map with traditional top-down greenness exposure metrics such as Normalised Differential Vegetation Index (NDVI) and a Street view based Green View Index (SGVI). Furthermore, we compared greenness visibility at street-only locations with total neighbourhood greenness visibility. We found strong to moderate correlations (r = 0.65–0.42, p {$<$} 0.05) between greenness visibility and mean NDVI, with a decreasing trend in correlation strength at increasing buffer distances from observer locations. Our findings suggest that top-down and eye-level measurements of greenness are two distinct metrics for assessing greenness exposure. Additionally, VGVI showed a strong correlation (r = 0.481, p {$<$} 0.01) with SGVI. Although the new VGVI has good agreement with existing street view based measures, we found that street-only greenness visibility values are not wholly representative of total neighbourhood visibility due to the under-representation of visible greenness in locations such as backyards and community parks. Our new methodology overcomes such underestimations, is easily transferable, and offers a computationally efficient approach to assessing eye-level greenness exposure. © 2020 The Authors},

The study aims to understand the current species diversity, composition and structure in different classes of greens prevalent in the city. As urban green spaces (UGS) are also reservoirs of carbon stock, the study estimates their biomass. Through rigorous field work, data were collected from 246 sample plots across various UGS classes as pre-stratification. Then the biomass was estimated using non-destructive method with species-specific equation. The diversity of tree species recorded in UGS varies, with high diversity recorded in avenue plantation and institutional compounds. The overall variation in species composition among UGS classes was 36.8\%. While in managed greens the species composition was similar, in institutional greens and forest it was different. Particularly, in forest the evenness was high with low diversity and low species richness. The structural distribution indicate lack of old trees in the city, with high number of tree species between diameter classes of 10-40 cm. Biomass was recorded high in road-side plantations (335 t ha-1) and playgrounds (324 t ha-1), and trees with bigger girth size where the main contributors. The dominant species indicates that high growth rate, tolerance to drought and pollution are the key attributes considered for species selection by local authorities. Though the city holds green image, vegetation along the avenues and institutions are stressed, exposed, and threatened by felling activities for grey infrastructure expansions. In such scenario, protection and preservation of older trees is crucial to maintain the carbon stock of the city. In addition, local authorities need to focus on effective afforestation programs through public participation to achieve high survival rate and reduce the maintenance cost. For species selection in addition to phenology and growth rate, tree biomass and life span needs to be considered to significantly enhance the urban environment and increase the benefits derived from UGS. © 2020 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Many ornamental species growing in cities have considerable allergenic potential and pose a risk to allergy sufferers. Such species include members of the genus Platanus, or London plane tree, which is increasingly prevalent in a number of southern European cities. Analysis of airborne pollen concentrations enables biological air quality to be assessed, and also provides information on the local distribution of vegetation. The aim of this study was to analyze trends in annual Platanus pollen concentrations in central Spain and to determine the extent to which they are linked to the presence of this species in urban green spaces. The results point to a correlation between the growing number of plane trees and an increase both in the annual pollen index and in the number of days on which allergy sufferers are at risk. Analysis suggests that variations in the diversity and abundance of allergenic ornamental species in urban green spaces may account for the trends observed in the dynamics and behavior of airborne pollen from these species.

  abstract = {Urban green space, or natural environments, are associated with multiple physical and mental health outcomes. Several proposed pathways of action for these benefits (e.g., stress reduction and attention restoration) require visual perception of green space; however, existing green space exposure measures commonly used in epidemiological studies do not capture street-scale exposures. We downloaded 254 Google Street View (GSV) panorama images from Portland, Oregon and calculated percent of green in each image, called Green View Index (GVI). For these locations we also calculated satellite-based normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), \% tree cover, \% green space, \% street tree buffering, distance to parks, and several neighborhood socio-economic variables. Correlations between the GVI and other green space measures were low (−0.02 to 0.50), suggesting GSV-based measures captured unique information about green space exposures. We further developed a GVI:NDVI ratio, which was associated with the amount of vertical green space in an image. The GVI and GVI:NDVI ratio were weakly related to neighborhood socioeconomic status and are therefore less susceptible to confounding in health studies compared to other green space measures. GSV measures captured unique characteristics of the green space environment and offer a new approach to examine green space and health associations in epidemiological research.},

  abstract = {The influence of urbanization on vegetation phenology is gaining considerable attention due to its implications for human health, cycling of carbon and other nutrients in Earth system. In this study, we examined the relationship between change in vegetation phenology and urban size, an indicator of urbanization, for the conterminous United States. We studied more than 4500 urban clusters of varying size to determine the impact of urbanization on plant phenology, with the aids of remotely sensed observations since 2003–2012. We found that phenology cycle (changes in vegetation greenness) in urban areas starts earlier (start of season, SOS) and ends later (end of season, EOS), resulting in a longer growing season length (GSL), when compared to the respective surrounding urban areas. The average difference of GSL between urban and rural areas over all vegetation types, considered in this study, is about 9 days. Also, the extended GSL in urban area is consistent among different climate zones in the United States, whereas their magnitudes are varying across regions. We found that a tenfold increase in urban size could result in an earlier SOS of about 1.3 days and a later EOS of around 2.4 days. As a result, the GSL could be extended by approximately 3.6 days with a range of 1.6–6.5 days for 25th   75th quantiles, with a median value of about 2.1 days. For different vegetation types, the phenology response to urbanization, as defined by GSL, ranges from 1 to 4 days. The quantitative relationship between phenology and urbanization is of great use for developing improved models of vegetation phenology dynamics under future urbanization, and for developing change indicators to assess the impacts of urbanization on vegetation phenology. © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons Ltd},

  abstract = {Most of current products can partially reach the requirement of high spatial and temporal resolution needed in urban applications. Fortunately, the new generation of satellite in a form of constellation, e.g. Europe's Sentinel-2, China's HJ-1A/B and GF-1/6, is expected to provide more frequent observations (¡1 week) with a higher spatial resolution (¡30 m). Consequently, a proper method should be selected to construct high spatio-temporal time-series NDVI and to derive phenological features for urban applications. In this study, a high spatio-temporal NDVI product for urban scale vegetation time series is conducted based on HJ-1A/B data. Three related issues, i.e. the optimal filter, time series decomposition, phenological features derivation are addressed. In addition, the effect of spatial and temporal resolution on the phenological features extraction is also discussed according to the comparison between the derived NDVI product and that extracted from MODIS. The results show that the Savitzky-Golay (S-G) filter is the best filter for the reconstruction of HJ NDVI time series. There is some difference for phenology derivation using “season” and “season + trend” depending on the absence/presence of breakpoints in the curve. The spatial details of phenological features can be built by the high-spatial time-series NDVI, showing a great potential in urban applications. Compared with the MODIS NDVI time series, HJ NDVI time series can get more detail information than overall phenological features because of its high spatio-temporal resolution. © 2017 Elsevier GmbH},

  abstract = {Seasonal phenology of vegetation plays an important role in global carbon cycle and ecosystem productivity. In urban environments, vegetation phenology is also important because of its influence on public health (e.g., allergies), and energy demand (e.g. cooling effects). In this study, we studied the potential use of remotely sensed observations (i.e. Landsat data) to derive some phenology indicators for vegetation embedded within the urban core domains in four distinctly different U.S. regions (Washington, D.C., King County in Washington, Polk County in Iowa, and Baltimore City and County in Maryland) during the past three decades. We used all available Landsat observations (circa 3000 scenes) from 1982 to 2015 and a self-adjusting double logistic model to detect and quantify the annual change of vegetation phenophases, i.e. indicators of seasonal changes in vegetation. The proposed model can capture and quantify not only phenophases of dense vegetation in rural areas, but also those of mixed vegetation in urban core domains. The derived phenology indicators show a good agreement with similar indicators derived from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and in situ observations, suggesting that the phenology dynamic depicted by the proposed model is reliable. The vegetation phenology and its seasonal and interannual dynamics demonstrate a distinct spatial pattern in urban domains with an earlier (9–14 days) start-of-season (SOS) and a later (13–20 days) end-of-season (EOS), resulting in an extended (5–30 days) growing season length (GSL) when compared to the surrounding suburban and rural areas in the four study regions. There is a general long-term trend of decreasing SOS (− 0.30 day per year), and increasing EOS and GSL (0.50 and 0.90 day per year, respectively) over past three decades for these study regions. The magnitude of these trends varies among the four urban systems due to their diverse local climate conditions, vegetation types, and different urban-rural settings. The Landsat derived phenology information for urban domains provides more details when compared to the coarse-resolution datasets such as MODIS, thus improves our understanding of human-natural systems interactions (or feedbacks) in urban domains. Such information is very valuable for urban planning in light of rapid urbanization and expansion of major metropolitans at the national and global levels. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

The green-up start dates were extracted from the MODIS-derived AGDD and EVI for 30 Mongolian oak (Quercus mongolica Fisch.) stands throughout South Korea. The relationship between green-up day of year needed to reach the AGDD threshold (DoYAGDD) and air temperature was closely maintained in data in both MODIS image interpretation and from 93 meteorological stations. Leaf green-up dates of Mongolian oak based on the AGDD threshold obtained from the records measured at five meteorological stations during the last century showed the same trend as the result of cherry observed visibly. Extrapolating the results, the spring onset of Mongolian oak and cherry has become earlier (14.5 ± 4.3 and 10.7 ± 3.6 days, respectively) with the rise of air temperature over the last century. The temperature in urban areas was consistently higher than that in the forest and the rural areas and the result was reflected on the vegetation phenology. Our study expanded the scale of the study on spring vegetation phenology spatiotemporally by combining satellite images with meteorological data. We expect our findings could be used to predict long-term changes in ecosystems due to climate change. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Street trees are often unequally distributed in urban areas, and their physical and structural attributes, such as extent of canopy cover, species composition, and size distribution, are also spatially heterogeneous. Some studies report that inequalities are more prevalent in streetscapes than in private landscapes. Considering the existing inequality issues and public nature of street trees, street tree inequality studies warrant greater attention. However, most existing studies in this field focus heavily on the unequal distribution of tree canopy cover, while disregarding other tree attributes. In this study, seven street tree measures covering tree abundance, species diversity, and size structure were derived from high-resolution satellite images, Google Street View, and street tree census. We then applied the geographically weighted regression to these seven tree measures in New York City, United States, compared street tree inequalities among different socioeconomic groups, and identified inequality hotspots. Our results show that street tree inequalities are greatest with respect to tree abundance and species diversity. Furthermore, race-based and education-based inequalities are most notable, and age-, income-, and household characteristic-based inequalities were also detected based on tree abundance or species diversity. Socially vulnerable areas that suffer the most severe inequalities are clustered in Brooklyn and Queens. Disaggregated street tree inequalities, with explicit recognition of the differentiated distribution of limited tree resources among different social groups and across geographical areas, are critical for effective decision-making to alleviate environmental inequities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

For Hefei City, during the study period, vegetation coverage in general decreased. The most obvious was the decline in Binhu New Area and Baohe Industrial Park, decreased values were 16.7\% and 21.4\%, respectively. The sharp reduction of vegetation cover caused by urban expansion is a remarkable ecological problem. Compared with the results of aerophotograph surveying, the value of vegetation fraction obtained by this method is higher in low vegetation-covered area, and which is lower in high vegetation-covered forest area, but the vegetation fraction change calculated by image -minus method can eliminate some system error and achieve higher precision in all areas, so image -minus method based on NDVI dimidiate pixel model can serve as an important means of monitoring vegetation cover.},

  abstract = {An increase in temperature due to greenhouse effects is manifest in the changes in diurnal, annual and inter-annual patterns, which may alter phenological events in plants. Flowering dates of four tree species, Prunus davidina, Prunus armeniaca, Robinia pseudoacacia and Syringa oblata, were significantly advanced in response to temperature increase over the years 1950-2004 in Beijing, China, due to the impact of urban climate warming. Because both climate warming and the urban heat island effect in winter and early-spring were more rapid than in late-spring and early summer, the dates in early flowering species advanced more quickly than in late flowering species. The early flowering species, P. davidina, advanced by 2.9 days/decade, while the other species advanced by 1.5-2.0 days/decade during 1950-2004. Therefore, the intervals between flowering dates of different species were expanded. P. davidina, flowering in early-spring, was much more sensitive to minimum and average temperatures (2.88-2.96 days/°C), but less sensitive to maximum temperature (2.46 days/°C). R. pseudoacacia, flowering late in the warmer season, was more sensitive to average and maximum temperatures (2.45-2.89 days/°C), but less sensitive to minimum temperature (1.91 days/°C). Statistical analysis showed that, in Beijing, plant flowering is most sensitive to average temperature over 30 days before average blossom date. On the basis of the temperature response curve, the goodness of fitting demonstrates that spring flowering dates can be predicted from the period when temperature is over 0 °C. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {The infiltration of stormwater runoff for use by urban trees is a major co-benefit of green infrastructure for desert cities with limited water resources. However, the effects of this passive irrigation versus regular, controlled moisture inputs, or active irrigation, is largely unquantified. We monitored the ecohydrology of urban mesquite trees (Prosopis spp.) under these contrasting irrigation regimes in semiarid Tucson, AZ. Measurements included soil moisture, sap velocity, canopy greenness, and leaf-area index. We expected both irrigation types to provide additional deep (¿20 cm) soil moisture compared to natural conditions, and that trees would depend on this deep moisture for transpiration and phenological activity. Results show that active irrigation supported higher soil moisture throughout the study than passive irrigation. Passive irrigation only provided additional deep moisture when green infrastructure features received impervious runoff from a city street. Sap velocity and greenness were similar under both irrigation types, outside of isolated periods of time. These differences occurred during the extremely wet summer 2017 when passively irrigated trees exhibited a greenness peak, and the dry conditions of spring when actively irrigated trees had higher sap flow and relative greenness. Finally, it was not determined that deep soil moisture had a stronger relationship with mesquite productivity than shallow moisture, but both relationships were stronger in the spring, before summer rains. This study aims to contribute empirical observations of green infrastructure performance for urban watershed management. © 2019 Luketich et al.

  abstract = {Urban green infrastructure plays an increasingly significant role in sustainable urban development planning as it provides important regulating and cultural ecosystem services. Monitoring of such dynamic and complex systems requires technological solutions which provide easy data collection, processing, and utilization at affordable costs. To meet these challenges a pilot study was conducted using a network of wireless, low cost, and multiparameter monitoring devices, which operate using Internet of Things (IoT) technology, to provide real-time monitoring of regulatory ecosystem services in the form of meaningful indicators for both human health and environmental policies. The pilot study was set in a green area situated in the center of Moscow, which is exposed to the heat island effect as well as high levels of anthropogenic pressure. Sixteen IoT devices were installed on individual trees to monitor their ecophysiological parameters from 1 July to 31 November 2019 with a time resolution of 1.5 h. These parameters were used as input variables to quantify indicators of ecosystem services related to climate, air quality, and water regulation. Our results showed that the average tree in the study area during the investigated period reduced extreme heat by 2 \&deg;C via shading, cooled the surrounding area by transferring 2167 \&plusmn; 181 KWh of incoming solar energy into latent heat, transpired 137 \&plusmn; 49 mm of water, sequestered 8.61 \&plusmn; 1.25 kg of atmospheric carbon, and removed 5.3 \&plusmn; 0.8 kg of particulate matter (PM10). The values of the monitored processes varied spatially and temporally when considering different tree species (up to five to ten times), local environmental conditions, and seasonal weather. Thus, it is important to use real-time monitoring data to deepen understandings of the processes of urban forests. There is a new opportunity of applying IoT technology not only to measure trees functionality through fluxes of water and carbon, but also to establish a smart urban green infrastructure operational system for management.},

  abstract = {Land-use/land-cover change is the most vulnerable factor in any developing urban environment. Increased infrastructure and population density tend to alter the land features which in turn will have an impact on climate change and will increase the impervious layer. Study of trends in land-use/land-cover change is required for analyzing the possible ways of managing the natural system. In this study, the spatial and temporal changes of the urban and peri-urban landscape of the Chennai Metropolitan Area (CMA), Tamil Nadu, India, were analyzed using satellite images. Imageries from Landsat 5 (TM) and Landsat 8 (OLI/TIRS) sensors were taken for the years 1988, 1997, 2006, and 2017. Ensembles of remote sensing spectral indices (NDVI, MNDWI, NDBI, and NDBaI) were calculated for the land-use/land-cover classification. The confusion matrix was used for assessing the accuracy for the year 2017. The overall accuracy of the LULC classification obtained was 91.76\% with the kappa coefficient of 0.84. The results show that during the period of February 1988 to February 2017, the agriculture/fallow land, barren/semi-barren, vegetation, and water bodies/wetlands have decreased by 53.62\%, 1.45\%, 58.99\%, and 30.59\%, respectively. This decrease has contributed to an increase of 173.83\% in built-up area. About 26,881 ha of agriculture/fallow land, 10,482 ha of vegetation land, and 2454 ha of water bodies/wetlands were converted to built-up and other land-use over the period. This essentially meant that CMA has changed from predominantly an agricultural area (42.21\%) in 1988 to built-up area (48.72\%) in 2017. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

  abstract = {Ornamental trees in urban environment are a relevant cause of illness due to allergenic pollen airborne dispersed. The work presented here analyses the importance of ornamental tree distribution and investigates airborne pollen records using volumetric spore traps. Three localities in the southwest of Spain were studied: Don Benito (DB), Plasencia (PL), and Zafra (ZA), in the Extremadura region. Volumetric Hirst type spore traps recorded pollen levels continuously for three years. Ornamental street trees in the study area were identified, counted and mapped. Airborne pollen records were found to be related to the number of trees, the proximity of the trees to traps, the different pollination systems and wind direction. A total of 17635 trees, from all localities were counted, belonging to 67 species, 58\% anemophilous, 22\% entomophilous, and 20\% both pollination systems. Five species represented more than 50\% of the total number of ornamental trees: Platanus hispanica, Olea europaea, Ulmus minor, Acer negundo and Melia azedarach. The average total pollen concentration in gm−3 was 102 (DB), 93 (PL), and 99 (ZA)… Omitting the data for Quercus pollen, a statistically significant correlation between the number of trees at 0.5km around the spore traps and the types of pollen recorded was found. Some measures to decrease the amount of potential allergenic airborne pollen in urban environments were identified, such as reducing trees with anemophilic pollination systems, eliminating male trees and employing suitable pruning practices. In any case, the closer the source of ornamental pollen, the greater the allergenic risks.},

  abstract = {The vast majority of measurements in the field of plant hydraulics have been on small-diameter branches from woody species. These measurements have provided considerable insight into plant functioning, but our understanding of plant physiology and ecology would benefit from a broader view, because branch hydraulic properties are influenced by many factors. Here, we discuss the influence that other components of the hydraulic network have on branch vulnerability to embolism propagation. We also modelled the impact of changes in the ratio of root-to-leaf areas and soil texture on vulnerability to hydraulic failure along the soil-to-leaf continuum and showed that hydraulic function is better maintained through changes in root vulnerability and root-to-leaf area ratio than in branch vulnerability. Differences among species in the stringency with which they regulate leaf water potential and in reliance on stored water to buffer changes in water potential also affect the need to construct embolism resistant branches. Many approaches, such as measurements on fine roots, small individuals, combining sap flow and psychrometry techniques, and modelling efforts, could vastly improve our understanding of whole-plant hydraulic functioning. A better understanding of how traits are coordinated across the whole plant will improve predictions for plant function under future climate conditions.},

  abstract = {Climate-driven shifts in phenology, which are being observed worldwide, affect ecosystem services, trophic interactions, and community composition, presenting challenges to managers in protected areas. Resource management benefits from local, species-specific phenology information. However, phenology monitoring programs in heterogeneous landscapes typically require serendipitous historical records or many years of contemporary data before trends in phenological responses to changes in climate can be analyzed. Here, we used a trails-as-transects approach to rapidly accumulate monitoring data across environmental gradients on three mountains in Acadia National Park, Maine, USA, and compared our results to phenological changes observed in Concord, Massachusetts, USA. In four years of intensive monitoring of transects on three mountains, we found large variability in spring temperatures across the mountains, but consistent patterns of advancing flower and leaf phenology in warmer microclimates. Reduced sampling intensity would have yielded similar results, but a shorter duration would not have revealed these patterns. The plants in Acadia responded to warming spring temperatures by shifting leaf and flower phenology in the same direction (earlier), but at a reduced rate (as measured in d/°C), in comparison with plants in southern New England (e.g., Concord, Massachusetts, USA). Our approach takes advantage of topographical complexity and associated microclimate gradients to substitute for long time series, allowing for rapid assessment of phenological response to climate. Other climate gradients (e.g., urban-to-rural, latitudinal, or coastal-to-inland) could work similarly. This intensive monitoring over a short time period quickly builds a robust dataset and can inform management decisions regarding future monitoring strategies, including sampling designs for citizen science-based phenology monitoring programs. © 2019 The Authors.},

The science of urban tree growth modeling is fundamental to quantifying these services. This paper describes three long-term tree growth studies conducted to evaluate tree performance because repeated measurements of the same trees produce critical data for growth model calibration and validation. Several empirical and process-based approaches to modeling tree growth are reviewed. Modeling is more advanced in the fields of forestry and pomology than in urban forestry. The USDA Forest Service’s reference city research has developed over 1,800 growth equations from measurements on more than 17,000 trees in 16 cities. The database is a valuable source of information that reflects regional differences in species composition, climate, soils, site conditions, and management practices. Several examples illustrate how differences in local climate and management practices can influence growth of a single species and the resulting value of services. Further advances in urban tree growth modeling are needed to inform the design, management, and modeling of high performing landscapes.},

  abstract = {Urban forests provide important ecosystem services to city residents, including pollution removal and carbon storage. Climate change and urbanization pose multiple threats to these services. However, how these threats combine to affect urban trees, and thus how to mitigate their effects, remains largely untested because multi-factorial experiments on mature trees are impractical. We used a unique urban warming experiment paired with a laboratory chamber experiment to determine how three of the most potentially damaging factors associated with global change for urban and rural trees—warming, drought, and insect herbivory—affect growth of Quercus phellos (willow oak), the most commonly planted large shade tree in the southeastern US, which is known for its resilience to these potential stressors. In a previous study, we found that the urban heat island effect was associated with reduced growth of Q. phellos and higher abundance of Parthenolecanium scale insects, key pests of oaks in cities. Here, we tested the hypothesis that tree water stress is the mechanism for these effects of warming. We found evidence that water stress is a major, interactive factor reducing urban tree growth, but found no evidence that water stress is associated with Parthenolecanium survival or abundance. Warming and Parthenolecanium only reduced growth in Q. phellos saplings that were simultaneously water stressed. Synthesis and applications. Across many temperate cities worldwide, urban trees grow less than rural trees. Our results point to water stress as the most likely driver for this pattern. Importantly, we found that water stress both reduces tree growth on its own and exacerbates effects of warming and insect pests on tree growth. Therefore, management strategies targeted at increasing tree hydration in cities may reduce effects of these three key stressors that are expected to intensify with further urbanization and climate change.},

In this study, spatio-temporal variation indicators were established to characterize landscape structure changes based on temporal analysis combined with spatial information obtained using dense Landsat time series in Changting County, Fujian, Province, China. All available Landsat images from 1987 to 2017 were collected. The fractal dimension (FD) of the spatial neighbor normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) derived from the Landsat images was calculated. Four change patterns (stable, increasing, decreasing, and wave) were explored using the ordinary least-squares method between abrupt change points performed by a Mann–Kendall test on the FD time series to characterize the spatio-temporal dynamics. The results showed that 49.98\% of the landscape structure in the study area decreased over the 31-year study period. The forest and water were dominated by decreasing patterns (67.00\% and 56.27\%); the urban land and cropland were dominated by wave patterns (50.07\% and 50.95\%); bare land regions were dominated by wave patterns and increasing patterns (50.52\% and 31.38\%). Wide and discontinuous landscape structures with high heterogeneity were replaced by landscape patches. The regional landscape structure heterogeneity increased in the bare land regions and other homogeneous landscape structures, while the decreases may be coupled with internal landscape structure changes. It was concluded that the spatial and temporal variations of the change patterns and change processes determined based on the FD of the NDVI in the spatial neighbor region are systematic indicators and can be used to detect landscape structure changes successfully and provide insights into dynamic trends. © 2019},

  abstract = {Urbanization has caused environmental changes, such as urban heat islands (UHIs), that affect terrestrial ecosystems. However, how and to what extent urbanization affects plant phenology remains relatively unexplored. Here, we investigated the changes in the satellite-derived start of season (SOS) and the covariation between SOS and temperature (RT) in 85 large cities across the conterminous United States for the period 2001–2014. We found that 1) the SOS came significantly earlier (6.1 ± 6.3 d) in 74 cities and RT was significantly weaker (0.03 ± 0.07) in 43 cities when compared with their surrounding rural areas (P {$<$} 0.05); 2) the decreased magnitude in RT mainly occurred in cities in relatively cold regions with an annual mean temperature {$<$}17.3 °C (e.g., Minnesota, Michigan, and Pennsylvania); and 3) the magnitude of urban−rural difference in both SOS and RT was primarily correlated with the intensity of UHI. Simulations of two phenology models further suggested that more and faster heat accumulation contributed to the earlier SOS, while a decrease in required chilling led to a decline in RT magnitude in urban areas. These findings provide observational evidence of a reduced covariation between temperature and SOS in major US cities, implying the response of spring phenology to warming conditions in nonurban environments may decline in the warming future.},

Yet drive-by deployments are often characterized by small fleets, huge costs and lack of flexibility to adapt to a city’s multiple sensing needs. The City Scanner project aims to accelerate the development of driveby sensing by turning everyday vehicles into sensing nodes. In this paper we present Greta II, a solar-powered sensing platform that allows for low-cost continuous data collection and streaming of multiple phenomena. Thanks to a modular design it can be customized with off-the-shelf sensors and re-used across different deployments. Greta II can be easily built and deployed without disrupting a vehicle’s normal operation. The platform has been validated during test deployments in two large American cities to collect air quality data. Drawing on our experience building and deploying Greta II we discuss challenges to be solved for enabling large-scale drive-by sensing.},

  abstract = {Urban tree plantings for climate-adapted and resilient cities need to consider growth, vitality and ecosystem services of the planted tree species particularly during drought. However, information on growth and ecosystem services of urban trees under changed climate conditions are rare for most species. This study investigated the intra-annual growth patterns of two common but physiologically contrasting urban tree species: small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata) and black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia). Although meteorological variables at the study site in the outer city center of Munich, Germany for the year 2016 were similar to the long-term average climate (1961–1990) different growth patterns were found. This was mainly influenced by species characteristics (water use efficiency, wood anatomy) leading to different transpiration rates and reaction patterns to drought stress. Moreover, species’ drought reactions compared to past years were analyzed in detail with a retrospective dendrochronological approach. Distinct species patterns were identified, highlighting the greater drought tolerance and recovery of R. pseudoacacia compared to T. cordata. These results show that under a drier and warmer climate T. cordata can provide more canopy air cooling for short periods of time due to high transpiration, albeit this is at the expense of great water demands and following growth declines under water shortage. Contrary, R. pseudoacacia proved to be a more suitable and adapted species at sites with less water availability due to better water use efficiency, even at the cost of low canopy transpiration though higher soil moisture and latent heat exchange from the soil.},

  abstract = {Quantification and analysis of urban greenness is important in evaluating the role of urban trees in carbon sequestration and regulating land surface temperature of an urban environment. Landsat 8 satellite data was used to evaluate the effects of urban heat island based on land surface temperature (LST) in the affluent suburb of Rosebank in the north and the previously marginalized township of Soweto south of Johannesburg. It was found that the LST of Soweto was 2.58 °C hotter than Rosebank, suggesting that high-density areas with less street trees and parks are hotter than low-density suburbs. The Pearson's correlation coefficient computed between the LST and the Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) or the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for the two areas, Rosebank and Soweto showed a positive correlation of 0.92 and 0.98) and a negative correlation of −0.91 and −0.99 respectively. The correlation between the NDVI and NDBI also showed negative values of −0.90 and −0.85, respectively. Based on the global bench mark for safe solar UVI, the residents of Soweto are likely to be at risk of skin and eye damage due to prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation than the residents of Rosebank. Thus, this study has effectively computed and evaluated the land surface temperatures of the two study areas from Landsat 8 satellite data, an information which can help potential vegetation cover programs to improve existing disparity in urban greenness in the city of Johannesburg. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Quantifying the carbon storage, distribution, and change of urban trees is vital to understanding the role of vegetation in the urban environment. At present, this is mostly achieved through ground study. This paper presents a method based on the satellite image time series, which can save time and money and greatly speed the process of urban forest carbon storage mapping, and possibly of regional forest mapping. Satellite imagery collected in different decades was used to develop a regression equation to predict the urban forest carbon storage from the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) computed from a time sequence (1985-1999) of Landsat image data. This regression was developed from the 1999 field-based model estimates of carbon storage in Syracuse, NY. The total carbon storage estimates based on the NDVI data agree closely with the field-based model estimates. Changes in total carbon storage by trees in Syracuse were estimated using the image data from 1985, 1992, and 1999. Radiometric correction was accomplished by normalizing the imagery to the 1999 image data. After the radiometric image correction, the carbon storage by urban trees in Syracuse was estimated to be 146,800 tons, 149,430 tons, and 148,660 tons of carbon for 1985, 1992, and 1999, respectively. The results demonstrate the rapid and cost-effective capability of remote sensing-based quantitative change detection in monitoring the carbon storage change and the impact of urban forest management over wide areas. © 2005 Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {Nature conservation and ecological restoration crucially depends on the knowledge about spatial patterns of plant species that control habitat conversion and disturbance regimes. Especially, species abundances are capable of indicating early development tendencies for setting habitat management strategies. This study demonstrates the transfer of field spectroscopy to hyperspectral imagery to map multiple plant species abundances in an open dryland area using two imaging spectrometers in two different phenological phases. We show that species abundances can partially be described by multiple gradients forming different coordinates in a contour map. For this purpose, species abundances were projected into an ordination space using non-metric multidimensional scaling and subsequent spatial interpolation. It was demonstrated that different gradients can be modeled in a Partial Least Squares regression framework resulting in distinct spectral features for certain gradient directions. We combine both objectives in a multiobjective NSGA-II procedure to maximize the quantitative determination of species abundance in ordination and spectral predictability in related field spectra, simultaneously. NSGA-II was finally used to select optimal spectral models for n=35 single species that were transferred to hyperspectral imagery for mapping purpose. We can show that abundance predictabilities can be evaluated on the basis of individual model performances that hold different spectral features for each species in a designated phenological phase. Finally, we present spatially explicit multi-species maps for the best n=18 and abundance maps for n=8 models that could be linked to patterns of species richness, coexistence, succession stages and habitat type conditions.},

This research investigates the hypothesis that it should be possible to use multispectral IKONOS images to quantify urban vegetation, obtaining similar accuracy to that achieved from false colour aerial photographs. Two parameters, vegetation cover and vegetation density are used to represent biomass in the study area (Kowloon, Hong Kong), for which data is collected for 41 field quadrats. Regression equations relating the field measurements of vegetation density to image wavebands obtained similar high correlations for both image types and lower but significant correlations for vegetation cover. Vegetation density is a quantifiable measure of vegetation in multiple layers above ground, representing the total amount of biomass and is thus well able to indicate the diverse structural types of vegetation found in urban areas. Furthermore it can be accurately measured using the IKONOS green/red ratio (Chlorophyll Index). The superiority of the latter to the more commonly used Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), is attributed to the sub-optimal timing of the imagery during the dry season, and its greater sensitivity to multiple layering within the vegetation canopy. A time and cost comparison between the two image types suggests that the use of IKONOS images is much more cost effective than aerial photographs for urban vegetation monitoring. © 2005 Taylor \& Francis Ltd.},

The strategic implementation of urban green infrastructure (UGI) e.g. street trees, parks, green roofs and facades can help achieve temperature reductions in urban areas while delivering diverse additional benefits such as pollution reduction and biodiversity habitat. Although the greatest thermal benefits of UGI are achieved in climates with hot, dry summers, there is comparatively little information available for land managers to determine an appropriate strategy for UGI implementation under these climatic conditions. We present a framework for prioritisation and selection of UGI for cooling. The framework is supported by a review of the scientific literature examining the relationships between urban geometry, UGI and temperature mitigation which we used to develop guidelines for UGI implementation that maximises urban surface temperature cooling. We focus particularly on quantifying the cooling benefits of four types of UGI: green open spaces (primarily public parks), shade trees, green roofs, and vertical greening systems (green walls and facades) and demonstrate how the framework can be applied using a case study from Melbourne, Australia.},

  abstract = {Evapotranspiration estimation has benefitted from recent advances in remote sensing and GIS techniques particularly in agricultural applications rather than urban environments. This paper explores the relationship between urban vegetation evapotranspiration (ET) and vegetation indices derived from newly-developed high spatial resolution WorldView-2 imagery. The study site was Veale Gardens in Adelaide, Australia. Image processing was applied on five images captured from February 2012 to February 2013 using ERDAS Imagine. From 64 possible two band combinations of WorldView-2, the most reliable one (with the maximum median differences) was selected. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) values were derived for each category of landscape cover, namely trees, shrubs, turf grasses, impervious pavements, and water bodies. Urban landscape evapotranspiration rates for Veale Gardens were estimated through field monitoring using observational-based landscape coefficients. The relationships between remotely sensed NDVIs for the entire Veale Gardens and for individual NDVIs of different vegetation covers were compared with field measured urban landscape evapotranspiration rates. The water stress conditions experienced in January 2013 decreased the correlation between ET and NDVI with the highest relationship of ET-Landscape NDVI (Landscape Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) for shrubs (r2=0.66) and trees (r2=0.63). However, when the January data was excluded, there was a significant correlation between ET and NDVI. The highest correlation for ET-Landscape NDVI was found for the entire Veale Gardens regardless of vegetation type (r2=0.95, p \&gt; 0.05) and the lowest one was for turf (r2=0.88, p \&gt; 0.05). In support of the feasibility of ET estimation by WV2 over a longer period, an algorithm recently developed that estimates evapotranspiration rates based on the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) from MODIS was employed. The results revealed a significant positive relationship between ETMODIS and ETWV2 (r2=0.9857, p \&gt; 0.05). This indicates that the relationship between NDVI using high resolution WorldView-2 imagery and ground-based validation approaches could provide an effective predictive tool for determining ET rates from unstressed mixed urban landscape plantings. © 2014 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Sensors can measure air quality, traffic congestion, and other aspects of urban environments. The fine-grained diagnostic information they provide could help urban managers to monitor a city’s health. Recently, a “drive-by” paradigm has been proposed in which sensors are deployed on third-party vehicles, enabling wide coverage at low cost. Research on drive-by sensing has mostly focused on sensor engineering, but a key question remains unexplored: How many vehicles would be required to adequately scan a city? Here, we address this question by analyzing the sensing power of a taxi fleet. Taxis, being numerous in cities, are natural hosts for the sensors. Using a ball-in-bin model in tandem with a simple model of taxi movements, we analytically determine the fraction of a city’s street network sensed by a fleet of taxis during a day. Our results agree with taxi data obtained from nine major cities and reveal that a remarkably small number of taxis can scan a large number of streets. This finding appears to be universal, indicating its applicability to cities beyond those analyzed here. Moreover, because taxis’ motion combines randomness and regularity (passengers’ destinations being random, but the routes to them being deterministic), the spreading properties of taxi fleets are unusual; in stark contrast to random walks, the stationary densities of our taxi model obey Zipf’s law, consistent with empirical taxi data. Our results have direct utility for town councilors, smart-city designers, and other urban decision makers.},

  abstract = {The differences in plant phenology between rural and urban areas are the subject of research conducted all over the world. There are few studies aimed at assessing the impact of the urban heat island on plant vegetation only in urban areas. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the distance from the city center and the form of land cover on the phenological development of trees using the example of the horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum L.). The research area covered the entire city of Wrocław. In order to best capture the impact of the distance from the city center on the rate of changes of individual phenophases, 3 areas were designated—at a distance of 1 km, 2 km and 5 km. The study assessed the average duration of individual phenological phases along with the variability characteristics for leafing, flowering and fruiting in relation to the designated zones and classified forms of land cover based on mean value (x̅) and standard deviation (± SD) in individual weeks of the year. For the leafing and flowering phases, the frequency of the occurrence of phases in individual weeks of the year was analyzed in relation to the designated zones and classified land use methods. The results obtained on the basis of phenological observations carried out in 2017 in Wrocław confirmed the extension of the period of vegetation in the city center in relation to its peripheries. Trees growing in road lanes entered the vegetation period later and defoliated faster, which confirms the negative impact of street conditions on the development of trees in urban space. Thus, the growing season in road lanes is shorter and due to the 1‐year observation period, it is justified to conduct further observations. © 2020 by the authors.

The urban areas spanned 21 of 29 Koppen–Geiger climatic zones, and all 19 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations global ecofloristic zones. Time period and grain GUTI is based on the most recent collections of urban tree inventories and species lists compiled by local authorities or reported in the scientific literature. Most data have been collected or updated since 2010. Major taxa and level of measurement Four thousand seven hundred and thirty-four tree species (c. 8\% of the global known arboreal flora).

This article reports the results of a systematic expert rating of tree inventories aiming to quantify the relative importance of each parameter. Using the Delphi method, panels comprising city officials, arborists, and academics rated a total of 148 parameters. The total mean score, the top ranking parameters, which can serve as a guide for decision-making at practical level and for standardization of tree inventories, were: Scientific name of the tree species and genera, Vitality, Coordinates, Hazard class, and Identification number. The study also examined whether the different responsibilities and usage of urban tree databases among organizations and people engaged in urban tree inventories affected their prioritization. The results revealed noticeable dissimilarities in the ranking of parameters between the panels, underlining the need for collaboration between the research community and those commissioning, administrating, and conducting inventories. Only by applying such a transdisciplinary approach to parameter selection can urban tree inventories be strengthened and made more relevant.},

  abstract = {Background Pollen is naturally emitted and is relevant for health, crop sciences and monitoring climate change, among others. Despite their relevance, pollen is often insufficiently monitored resulting in a lack of data. Thus, spatial modelling of pollen concentrations for unmonitored areas is necessary. The aim of this study was to develop an automatic system for calculating daily pollen concentrations at sites without regular pollen monitoring. Method We used data from 14 pollen taxa collected during 2015 at 26 stations distributed across Bavaria, Germany. The proposed system was based on the Kriging interpolation method to spatially model pollen concentrations for unmonitored areas, in combination with regression of environmental parameters. The method also took into account weather effects on daily pollen concentrations. Results An automatic system was developed for calculating current pollen concentrations at any location of the county. The results were displayed as daily pollen concentrations per m3 in maps of 1 km2 resolution. The models are trained automatically for every day by using the pollen and weather inputs. Automatic inputs will increase the usability of the model. In 50\% of the cases, Gaussian Kriging was selected as the optimal model. An R2 of 0.5 is reached in external validation without considering the effect of the weather. An R2 of 0.7 is reached after considering the effect of daily weather parameters. Conclusions A fully automatic pollen network (ePIN) was built in Bavaria during 2018 that delivers data on-line without delay. The proposed method allows for a comparably small number of automatic devices per study area, but still providing information on pollen on any location in the study area.},

Here we evaluate the electronic Pollen Information Network (ePIN) comprising 8 automatic BAA500 pollen monitors in Bavaria, Germany. Automatic BAA500 and manual Hirst-type pollen traps were run simultaneously at the same locations for one pollen season. Classifications by BAA500 were checked by experts in pollen identification, which is traditionally considered to be the “gold standard” for pollen monitoring. BAA500 had a multiclass accuracy of over 90\%. Correct identification of any individual pollen taxa was always {$>$}85\%, except for Populus (73\%) and Alnus (64\%). The BAA500 was more precise than the manual method, with less discrepancies between determinations by pairs of automatic pollen monitors than between pairs of humans. The BAA500 was online for 97\% of the time. There was a significant correlation of 0.84 between airborne pollen concentrations from the BAA500 and Hirst-type pollen traps. Due to the lack of calibration samples it is unknown which instrument gives the true concentration. The automatic BAA500 network delivered pollen data rapidly (3~h delay with real-time), reliably and online.

  abstract = {Urbanization is a global phenomenon with still unknown consequences for vegetation dynamics of urban ecosystems, especially in subtropical areas of developing countries. In this paper we analyze the vegetation productivity trend associated to urban densification and urban expansion during the last decade, in twelve cities of northern Argentina. We used time series analysis of MODIS-NDVI images to reconstruct the phenological patterns to retrieve a productivity trend under three spatial classes of urban dynamics: (1) urban, (2) expansion and (3) periphery. Our results show that trends in vegetation productivity are more associated to the environmental characteristics (basal productivity and climate) than to the land cover class. The average trend in productivity in urban areas ranged between -2.54\% year-1 (Metán) and -0.22\% year-1 (Concepción). In contrast, the range was much tighter between classes; it was -1.37\% year-1 in urban areas and -1.21\% in the periphery. In this sense we found significant differences between cities, but no significant differences were observed between classes. Urban growth and urban expansion patterns found in our study suggest the system dynamics is dominated by sprawl patterns rather than by a homogeneous densification. Related to this phenomenon, our results dismissed the idea of urban expansion as the main factor affecting vegetation phenology and supported the hypothesis of regional warming as an explanation for the decrease in vegetation productivity, probably due to the decrease of water balance in arid regions. © 2016 Elsevier GmbH.},

Digital repeat photography, in particular, can characterize the seasonality of canopy greenness. However, these data cannot be directly compared to satellite vegetation indices (e.g. NDVI, the normalized difference vegetation index) that require information about vegetation properties at near-infrared (NIR) wavelengths. Here, we develop a new method, using an inexpensive, NIR-enabled camera originally designed for security monitoring, to calculate a “camera NDVI” from sequential visible and visible+NIR photographs. We use a lab experiment for proof-of-concept, and then test the method using a year of data from an ongoing field campaign in a mixed temperate forest. Our analysis shows that the seasonal cycle of camera NDVI is almost identical to that of NDVI measured using narrow-band radiometric instruments, or as observed from space by the MODIS platform. This camera NDVI thus provides different information about the state of the canopy than can be obtained using only visible-wavelength imagery. In addition to phenological monitoring, our method should be useful for a variety of applications, including continuous monitoring of plant stress and quantifying vegetation responses to manipulative treatments in large field experiments.},

  abstract = {Urbanization is responsible for some of the fastest rates of land-use change around the world, with important consequences for local, regional, and global climate. Vegetation, which represents a significant proportion of many urban and suburban landscapes, can modify climate by altering local exchanges of heat, water vapor, and CO2. To determine how distinct urban forest communities vary in their microclimate effects over time, we measured stand-level leaf area index, soil temperature, infrared surface temperature, and soil water content over a complete growing season at 29 sites representing the five most common vegetation types in a suburban neighborhood of Minneapolis-Saint Paul, Minnesota. We found that seasonal patterns of soil and surface temperatures were controlled more by differences in stand-level leaf area index and tree cover than by plant functional type. Across the growing season, sites with high leaf area index had soil temperatures that were 7°C lower and surface temperatures that were 6°C lower than sites with low leaf area index. Site differences in mid-season soil temperature and turfgrass ground cover were best explained by leaf area index, whereas differences in mid-season surface temperature were best explained by percent tree cover. The significant cooling effects of urban tree canopies on soil temperature imply that seasonal changes in leaf area index may also modulate CO2 efflux from urban soils, a highly temperature-dependent process, and that this should be considered in calculations of total CO2 efflux for urban carbon budgets. Field-based estimates of percent tree cover were found to better predict mid-season leaf area index than satellite-derived estimates and consequently offer an approach to scale up urban biophysical properties. © 2010 The Author(s).},

The direct impact of UHI can be significant on both daytime and night-time temperatures, and the indirect impacts include increased air conditioning loads, deteriorated air and water quality, reduced pavement lifetimes, and exacerbated heat waves. Modifying the thermal properties and emissivity of roofs and paved surfaces and increasing the vegetated area within the city are potential mitigation strategies. A quantitative comparison of their efficacies and costs suggests that so-called cool roofs are likely the most cost-effective UHI mitigation strategy. However, additional research is needed on how to modify surface emissivities and dynamically control surface and material properties, as well as on the health and socioeconomic impacts of UHI.},

The diversity of small collections, all of whose members can be identified and counted, is defined by Brillouin's measure of information. With larger collections it becomes necessary to estimate diversity; what is estimated is Shannon's measure of information which is a function of the population proportions of the several species. Different methods of estimation are appropriate for different types of collections. If the collection can be randomly sampled and the total number of species is known, Basharin's formula may be used. With a random sample from a population containing an unknown number of species, Good's method is sometimes applicable. With a patchy population of sessile organisms, such as a plant community, random samples are unobtainable since the contents of a randomly placed quadrat are not a random sample of the parent population. To estimate the diversity of such a community a method is proposed whereby the sample size is progressively increased by addition of new quadrats; as this is done the diversity of the pooled sample increases and then levels off. The mean increment in total diversity that results from enlarging the sample still more then provides an estimate of the diversity per individual in the whole population.},

  abstract = {Our cities are the frontier where the battle to achieve the global sustainable development agenda over the next decade would be won or lost. This requires an evidence-based approach to local decision-making and resource allocation, which can only be possible if current gaps in urban data are bridged. Earth observation (EO) offers opportunities to provide timely, spatially disaggregated information that supports this need. Spatially disaggregated information, which is also demanded by cities for forward planning and land management, has not received much attention largely due to three reasons: (i) the cost of generating this data through traditional methods remains high; (ii) the technical capacity in geospatial sciences in many countries is low due to a shortage of skilled professionals who can find and/or process available data; and (iii) the inertia against disturbing routine workflows and adopting new practices that are not imposed through legal requirements at the country level. In support of overcoming the first two challenges, this paper discusses the importance of EO data in the urban context, how it is already being used by some city leaders for decision making, and what other applications it offers in the realm of urban sustainability monitoring. It also illustrates how the EO community, via the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and its members, is working to make this data more easily accessible and lower barriers of use by policymakers and urban practitioners that are interested in implementing and tracking sustainable development in their jurisdictions. The paper concludes by shining a light on the challenges that remain to be overcome for better adoption of EO data for urban decision making through better communication between the two groups, to enable a more effective alignment of the produced data with the users’ needs.},

While we are well informed about forest growth under recent conditions, it is unclear if this knowledge can be simply transferred to urban environments. Based on tree ring analyses in ten metropolises worldwide, we show that, in general, urban trees have undergone accelerated growth since the 1960s. In addition, urban trees tend to grow more quickly than their counterparts in the rural surroundings. However, our analysis shows that climate change seems to enhance the growth of rural trees more than that of urban trees. The benefits of growing in an urban environment seem to outweigh known negative effects, however, accelerated growth may also mean more rapid ageing and shortened lifetime. Thus, city planners should adapt to the changed dynamics in order to secure the ecosystem services provided by urban trees.},

  abstract = {Vegetation phenology manifests the rhythm of annual plant life activities. It has been extensively studied in natural ecosystems. However, major knowledge gaps still exist in understanding the impacts of urbanization on vegetation phenology. This study addresses two questions to fill the knowledge gaps: (1) How does vegetation phenology vary spatially and temporally along a rural-to-urban transect in Shanghai, China, over the past three decades? (2) How do landscape composition and configuration affect those variations of vegetation phenology? To answer these questions, 30 m × 30 m mean vegetation phenology metrics, including the start of growing season (SOS), end of growing season (EOS), and length of growing season (LOS), were derived for urban vegetation using dense stacks of enhanced vegetation index (EVI) time series from images collected by Landsat 5-8 satellites from 1984 to 2015. Landscape pattern metrics were calculated using high spatial resolution aerial photos. We then used Pearson correlation analysis to quantify the associations between phenology patterns and landscape metrics. We found that vegetation in urban centers experienced advances of SOS for 5-10 days and delays of EOS for 5-11 days compared with those located in the surrounding rural areas. Additionally, we observed strong positive correlations between landscape composition (percentage of landscape area) of developed land and LOS of urban vegetation. We also found that the landscape configuration of local land cover types, especially patch density and edge density, was significantly correlated with the spatial patterns of vegetation phenology. These results demonstrate that vegetation phenology in the urban area is significantly different from its rural surroundings. These findings have implications for urban environmental management, ranging from biodiversity protection to public health risk reduction. © 2017 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Land surface phenology (LSP) has been widely used as the “footprint” of urbanization and global climate change. Shifts of LSP have cascading effects on food production, carbon sequestration, water consumption, biodiversity, and public health. Previous studies mainly focused on investigating the effects of urbanization on the spatial patterns of LSP by comparing phenological metrics, e.g. start of season (SOS) and end of season (EOS), between urban center and the surrounding rural regions. However, it remains unclear how urbanization-induced land cover conversions and climate change jointly influence the temporal variations of SOS and EOS within the urban ecosystem. To fill this knowledge gap, we utilized daily two-band enhanced vegetation index, daily meteorological record, and annual land cover dataset to investigate the respective impacts of urbanization and climate change on temporal shifts of LSP between the post- and the pre-urbanization periods over 196 large cities in the northern mid-latitudes. We found 51\% of the cities experienced an advanced SOS with an average of −6.39 ± 5.82 days after urbanization has occurred, while the remaining 49\% of the cities had a delayed SOS with an average of 7.56 ± 5.63 days. We also found a later EOS at 53\% of the cities and an earlier EOS at 47\% of the cities with an average of 8.43 ± 7.59 and −5.57 ± 4.99 days between the post- and pre-urbanization periods, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis indicates that climate variables (i.e. temperature, precipitation, and insolation) play dominant roles in regulating the temporal shifts of LSP. Furthermore, the earlier SOS and later EOS were significantly correlated with the amplitude of urbanization (i.e. increase of impervious surface area) in cities after controlling for effects of climate factors. These patterns were generally consistent across eight climate zones. Our findings provide critical information in modeling natural and anthropogenic effects on urban ecosystem, with important benefits for urban sustainability and biodiversity conservation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

I test a hypothesis that successional status of hardwood tree species, rather than taxon, will differentially affect tree size relative to age, in forest versus street plantings. In central Ohio, USA, samples (N = 230) representing 15 native tree species were matched for size between rural woodlot and city street-side conditions. Their girth was measured and their age determined by a count of annual growth rings. Age and size data were analyzed by a general linear model. Most urban trees had smaller trunk diameters than rural conspecifics of the same age. However, trees of early and mid-successional ecologies, despite smaller girth, showed no reduction in growth rate over time. Late successional species appeared to be affected by proximity to impervious areas, showing reduced growth rates, and by inference,reduced ultimate size.},

  abstract = {Rapid growing urban population has resulted in the occupancy of large proportionate of the city and its outskirts, thereby contributing factors to change in the environmental conditions. This has resulted in widespread land acquisition for built up and industrial development, covering the centre of the city while moving at the outskirts of the city as well. Land Use /Land Cover (LULC) changes causes alterations in the land use categories, mostly the concrete forests which has increased the urban temperature as compared to the rural regions due to rapidly growing urbanized environment. Urban Heat Island (UHI) is one of the human-induced environmental phenomenon affecting the urban inhabitant in many ways, such as altering and disturbing the land cover its use which changes thermal energy flow causing elevated surface and air temperature. Temporal satellite datasets (LANDSAT ETM+ image of 1989, 2000 and 2006) can be used to monitor surface temperature while vegetation indices can be used to assess the coverage of the vegetation and non-vegetation area in the region. Temporal NDVI is employed in the study area to analyse the impact of land surface temperature against NDVI in the region. Therefore, temporal remotely sensed data can be used to map LULC and its dynamic changes and other environmental phenomena such as surface temperature over a period of time. Temporal UHI has been estimated using geospatial technology to incorporate it for environmental impact assessment on the surrounding environment. The present research focuses on temporal NDVI and Surface temperature, the methodology used altogether for the assessment of resolution dynamic UHI change on environmental condition for Haridwar district, Uttrakhand India and Kanpur district, Uttar Pradesh in India. Both case study has different environmental conditions, geographical locations and demography. Hilly and forested region with almost no industrial activities for Haridwar while several industrial activities and densely populated region Kanpur located in an Indo-Gangetic plain. The research outcome demonstrates the correlation between temporal NDVI and Surface temperature exemplified with case study conducted over two different regions, geographically as well as economically.

In the past 20 years, China has experienced rapid urbanization. Thus, it is imperative to understand the impact of urbanization on vegetation phenology in China. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the impact of urbanization on vegetation phenology at the national and climate zone scales using remotely sensed data. We found that the start of the growing season (SOS) was advanced by approximately 2.4 days (P \&lt; 0.01), and the end of the growing season (EOS) was delayed by approximately 0.7 days (P \&lt; 0.01) in the urban areas compared to the rural areas. As a result, the growing season length (GSL) was extended by approximately 3.1 days (P \&lt; 0.01). The difference in the SOS and GSL between the urban and rural areas increased from 2001 to 2014, with an annual rate of 0.2 days (R 2 = 0.39, P \&lt; 0.05) and 0.2 days (R 2 = 0.31, P \&lt; 0.05), respectively. We also found that the impact of urbanization on vegetation phenology varied among different vegetation types at the national and climate zone levels (P \&lt; 0.05). The SOS was negatively correlated with land surface temperature (LST), with a correlation coefficient of -0.24 (P \&lt; 0.01), and EOS and GSL were positively correlated with LST, with correlation coefficients of 0.56 and 0.44 (P \&lt; 0.01), respectively. The improved understanding of the impact of urbanization on vegetation phenology from this study will be of great help for policy-makers in terms of developing relevant strategies to mitigate the negative environmental effects of urbanization in China. © 2018 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Background: Understanding spatio-temporal dynamics of UF and its above-ground carbon storage (CS) is important for mitigating urban CO2 emissions under China's rapid urban expansion and greening. Methods: In our study, vegetation index (VI) data obtained from TM image and CS derived from field-based surveys were amalgamated to develop a regression model to predict spatio-temporal patterns of CS. VI correction model was established by normalizing previous imagery (1984, 1995, and 2005) to 2014 image data. Results: NDVI is better than other VIs for predicting urban forest CS. Both UF area and its CS increased gradually from 1984 to 2014, especially in outer rings of the city. CS showed a definite decreasing trend from outer rings to downtown. Due to urban greening policies, landscape patches of UF or CS recently became larger and more aggregated. The CS by UF class distribution was skewed toward low values in all the years, but the skew gradually decreased over time. It was estimated that the average annual increase of CS by UF could offset 3.9\% of the average annual increase in urban carbon emissions. Conclusions: Our study proposes that spatio-temporal changes in UF patterns dramatically affected the amount of CS and carbon capture. The increase in UF coverage and quality would mitigate more urban carbon emissions, especially in outer rings. © 2019 The Authors},

The present spatiotemporal analysis of olive flowering in central Spain combined geostatistical techniques with the application of a Geographic Information Systems, and compared results for flowering intensity with airborne pollen records. The results were used to obtain continuous phenological maps which determined the pattern of the succession of the olive flowering. The results show also that, although the highest airborne olive-pollen counts were recorded during the greatest flowering intensity of the groves closest to the pollen trap, the counts recorded at the start of the pollen season were not linked to local olive groves, which had not yet begin to flower. To detect the remote sources of olive pollen several episodes of pollen recorded before the local flowering season were analysed using a HYSPLIT trajectory model and the findings showed that western, southern and southwestern winds transported pollen grains into the study area from earlier-flowering groves located outside the territory.},

  abstract = {Global processes of urban growth lead to severe environmental impacts such as temperature increase with an intensification of the urban heat island effect, and hydrological changes with far reaching consequences for plant growth and human health and well-being. Urban trees can help to mitigate the negative effects of climate change by providing ecosystem services such as carbon storage, shading, cooling by transpiration or reduction of rainwater runoff. The extent of each ecosystem service is closely linked with the tree species as well as with a tree's age, size, structure and vitality. To evaluate the ecosystem services of urban trees, the process-based growth model CityTree was developed which is able to estimate not only tree growth but also the species-specific ecosystem services including carbon storage, transpiration and runoff, shading, and cooling by transpiration. The model was parametrized for the species small-leaved lime (Tilia cordata), robinia (Robinia pseudoacacia), plane (Platanus×acerifolia) and horse chestnut (Aesculus hippocastanum). The model validation for tree growth (stem diameter increment, coefficient of correlation=0.76) as well as for the water balance (transpiration, coefficient of correlation=0.92) seems plausible and realistic. Tree growth and ecosystem services were simulated and analyzed for Central European cities both under current climate conditions and for the future climate scenarios. The simulations revealed that urban trees can significantly improve the urban climate and mitigate climate change effects. The quantity of the improvements depends on tree species and tree size as well as on the specific site conditions. Such simulation scenarios can be a proper basis for planning options to mitigate urban climate changes in individual cities.},

  abstract = {Urban trees can potentially mitigate environmental degradation accompanying rapid urbanisation via a range of tree benefits and services. But uncertainty exists about the extent of tree benefits and services because urban trees also impose costs (e.g. asthma) and may create hazards (e.g. windthrow). Few researchers have systematically assessed how urban tree benefits and costs vary across different cities, geographic scales and climates. This paper provides a quantitative review of 115 original urban tree studies, examining: (i) research locations, (ii) research methods, and (iii) assessment techniques for tree services and disservices. Researchers published findings in 33 journals from diverse disciplines including: forestry, land use planning, ecology, and economics. Research has been geographically concentrated (64\% of studies were conducted in North America). Nearly all studies (91.3\%) used quantitative research, and most studies (60\%) employed natural science methods. Demonstrated tree benefits include: economic, social, health, visual and aesthetic benefits; identified ecosystem services include: carbon sequestration, air quality improvement, storm water attenuation, and energy conservation. Disservices include: maintenance costs, light attenuation, infrastructure damage and health problems, among others. Additional research is required to better inform public policy, including comparative assessment of tree services and disservices, and assessment of urban residents and land managers’ understanding of tree benefits and costs.},

  abstract = {How the urban environment influences vegetation phenology is important to understand the living environment and the climate-vegetation interaction. This study investigates changes in vegetation phenology in the urban environment using remote sensing data for 32 major cities in the Northern Hemisphere. Vegetation phenological information for both urban and rural areas of each individual city was derived from the remote sensing data. We found that the urban environment generally enhanced vegetation growth but at varied degrees for different regions in the Northern Hemisphere. Vegetation phenology metrics, including the start of season (SOS), the end of season (EOS), and the growing season length (GSL), have large differences between urban and rural environment. Vegetation SOS in urban areas occurred earlier than in rural areas for 22 in 32 cities, and the relationships between advanced urban SOS and the distance away from urban centers are significant for 9 cities. Vegetation EOS in urban areas occurred later than in rural areas for 19 in 32 cities, and the relationships between delayed urban EOS and the distance away from urban centers are significant for 10 cities. The response of SOS to the urban environment is found dependent upon the latitude of urban centers and urban spring daytime and nighttime temperatures. Analysis on ground observational records of vegetation phenology in the region of North America supports the findings derived from remote sensing data. These findings could help to understand the impacts of the urban environment on vegetation growth. ©2019. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

  abstract = {We developed and tested the use of light emitting diodes (LEDs) to monitor vegetation reflectance in narrow spectral bands as a tool suitable for quantifying and monitoring ecosystem structure, function and metabolism. LEDs are appealing because they are inexpensive, small and reliable light sources that, when used in reverse mode, can measure spectrally selective radiation. We selected LEDs in red and near-infrared wavebands as they are used to calculate the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). The lab experiments revealed that the LEDs showed linear relation with a hyper-spectral spectroradiometer (R2{$>$}0.94 and 0.99 for red and NIR, respectively) and marginal sensitivity to temperature. To test the efficacy of this novel sensor, we measured spectral reflectance with LEDs over an annual grassland in California over 3.5 years. The LED-sensor captured daily to interannual variation of the spectral reflectance at the two bands with reliable and stable performance. The spectral reflectance in the two bands and NDVI proved to be useful to identify the leaf-on and leaf-off dates (mean bias errors of 5.3 and 4.2 days, respectively) and to estimate canopy photosynthesis (R2=0.91). We suggest that this novel instrument can monitor other structural and functional (e.g. leaf area index, leaf nitrogen) variables by employing LEDs that have other specific wavelengths bands. Considering that off-the-shelf LEDs cover a wide range of wavebands from the ultraviolet to near-infrared regions, we believe that the research community could explore a range of similar instruments across a range of bands for a variety of ecological applications.},

  abstract = {Emerging near-surface remote sensing techniques have advanced our ability to monitor forest canopy phenology. Thus far, however, little effort has been made to monitor the phenologies of the various canopies of multi-layer forests separately, despite their importance in regulating forest biogeochemical cycles. Here we report phenological changes in multi-layer canopies of deciduous broadleaf and evergreen needleleaf forests in the Republic of Korea during the spring of 2013. We installed light-emitting diode (LED) sensors at four different canopy heights at two sites to measure the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) using red and near-infrared (NIR) spectral reflectance and to estimate leaf area index (LAI) using the blue band gap fraction. LED-sensors identified leaf-out dates of over- and understory canopies at both sites; leaves unfolded 8–11days earlier in the understory canopy than the overstory canopy. At the deciduous forest site, LED-NDVI failed to capture the leaf-out date in the overstory canopy, because all four LED-sensors started to see green-up from the understory canopy while the overstory canopy was leafless. LED-LAI identified different leaf-out dates for the over- and understory canopy, because the gap fraction was measured explicitly for each canopy layer. In the evergreen forest site, LED-NDVI signals between the top of the tower and beneath the overstory canopy were decoupled because of the dense evergreen overstory canopy. Both LED-NDVI and LED-LAI identified new needle expansion in the overstory canopy and understory canopy development. MODIS NDVI agreed well with LED-NDVI data (R2=0.96, RMSE=0.04) at the deciduous forest site, and we discovered that understory canopy development determined the onset of greenness based on MODIS NDVI data. LED-LAI data agreed well with independent estimates from the other instruments, indicating that LED-sensors could be used to monitor multi-layer canopy LAI. Continuous, in-situ observation of multi-layer canopy phenology will aid in the interpretation of satellite remote sensing phenology products and improve land surface models that adopt a multi-layer canopy model.},

In most European countries, pollen information is based on a weekly-cycle Hirst-type pollen trap method. This method is labour-intensive and requires narrow specialized abilities and substantial time, so that the pollen data are always delayed and subject to sampling- and counting-related uncertainties. Emerging new approaches to automatic pollen monitoring can, in principle, allow for real-time availability of the data with no human involvement.{$<$}/p{$>$} {$<$}p{$>$}The goal of the current paper is to evaluate the capabilities of the new Plair Rapid-E pollen monitor and to construct a first-level pollen recognition algorithm. The evaluation was performed for three devices located in Lithuania, Serbia and Switzerland, with independent calibration data and classification algorithms. The Rapid-E output data include multi-angle scattering images and the fluorescence spectra recorded at several times for each particle reaching the device. Both modalities of the Rapid-E output were treated with artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the results were combined to obtain the pollen type. For the first classification experiment, the monitor was challenged with a large variety of pollen types and the quality of many-to-many classification was evaluated. It was shown that in this case, both scattering- and fluorescence-based recognition algorithms fall short of acceptable quality. The combinations of these algorithms performed better, exceeding 80\&thinsp;\% accuracy for 5 out of 11 species. Fluorescence spectra showed similarities among different species, ending up with three well-resolved groups: (\emph{Alnus}, \emph{Corylus}, \emph{Betula} and \emph{Quercus}), (\emph{Salix} and \emph{Populus}) and (\emph{Festuca}, \emph{Artemisia} and \emph{Juniperus}). Within these groups, pollen is practically indistinguishable for the first-level recognition procedure. Construction of multistep algorithms with sequential discrimination of pollen inside each group seems to be one of the possible ways forward. In order to connect the classification experiment to existing technology, a short comparison with the Hirst measurements is presented and the issue of false positive pollen detections by Rapid-E is discussed.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Understanding how urban forest land cover responds to climate change requires knowledge of land-surface interaction processes, which control the degree to which interannual variability and mean trends in climatic variables affect the surface energy budget and by this forest vegetation. Urban forest represents unique areas for the detection of climatic change and the assessment of climate-related impacts. Effects of climate extremes and anthropogenic changes on urban/periurban forest systems in Romania can have both short-term and long-term implications for standing biomass, tree health and species composition. This paper used time series of normalized difference of vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) as well as leaf area index (LAI) as a measurement indicators of forest dynamics at metropolitan scale in order to assess impacts of climate changes on forest ecosystem phenology in metropolitan area of Bucharest. Use of satellite remote sensing to monitor the forest changes due to climatic stressors is an excellent example of the value of multispectral, multiresolution and multitemporal observations. Fusion technique was applied to time series satellite imagery data (Landsat TM/ETM/OLI, Sentinel 2 and MODIS Terra/Aqua satellite data) for urban/periurban forest ecosystem of Bucharest metropolitan area in Romania over 2000-2019 period. Also, this paper addresses a number of issues related to changes in land surface temperature (LST), and analyses correlations between NDVI/EVI time series and climatic variables under different scenarios for summer heat waves, windstorms and heavy precipitation. © 2020 SPIE.},

What’s more, those tools do not observe the urban landscape from a perspective in which citizens experience a city. We test a novel application of computer vision to quantify urban tree cover at the street-level. We do so by utilizing the open-source image data of city streetscapes that is now abundant (Google Street View). We show that a multi-step computer vision algorithm segments and quantifies the percent of tree cover in streetscape images to a high degree of precision. By then modelling the relationship between neighbouring images along city street segments, we are able to extend this image representation and estimate the amount of perceived tree cover in city streetscapes to a relatively high level of accuracy for an entire city. Though not a replacement for high resolution remote sensing (e.g., aerial LiDAR) or intensive field surveys, the method provides a new multi-feature metric of urban tree cover that quantifies tree presence and distribution from the same viewpoint in which citizens experience and see the urban landscape.},

For this purpose, Landsat-5 and Landsat-8 satellite data acquired in 2006, 2011 and 2016, respectively, were utilized, and Zonguldak, a province of Turkey, was selected as a test site. In the study, LST image for 2021 was projected using spectral indices, namely Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). Actually, the correlation analysis between four spectral indices (NDVI, SAVI, MNDWI and NDBI) and LST was conducted. However, NDBI and NDVI were determined as highly correlated indices with LST having correlation coefficient 0.89 and −0.90, respectively, thus MNDWI and SAVI were not considered for the further steps. A Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) analysis was carried out between these two indices (NDBI and NDVI) and LST to extract a mathematical model for LST retrieval. In order to obtain the future form of LST image (2021), these indices were simulated for 2021 using Markov Chain method and then regression model was applied. Before generating LST image for 2021, LST for 2016 image was simulated and compared with the existing 2016 LST image using Kappa index of agreement technique to evaluate the performance. The Kappa value was obtained as 0.73 which is reasonable for future simulation. SUHI evaluation was conducted based on the observed (2016) and simulated (2021) impervious area and normalized LST images. The obtained results showed that the distribution of SUHI effect was highly related to impervious area and if the urbanization rate in the study area continues as it is, this expansion will cause to a dramatic increase in SUHI distribution unless any proper urban planning model is considered by decision makers. © 2020 The Author(s)},

  abstract = {Monitoring vegetation phenology is critical for quantifying climate change impacts on ecosystems. We present an extensive dataset of 1783 site-years of phenological data derived from PhenoCam network imagery from 393 digital cameras, situated from tropics to tundra across a wide range of plant functional types, biomes, and climates. Most cameras are located in North America. Every half hour, cameras upload images to the PhenoCam server. Images are displayed in near-real time and provisional data products, including timeseries of the Green Chromatic Coordinate (Gcc), are made publicly available through the project web page (https://phenocam.sr.unh.edu/webcam/gallery/). Processing is conducted separately for each plant functional type in the camera field of view. The PhenoCam Dataset v2.0, described here, has been fully processed and curated, including outlier detection and expert inspection, to ensure high quality data. This dataset can be used to validate satellite data products, to evaluate predictions of land surface models, to interpret the seasonality of ecosystem-scale CO2 and H2O flux data, and to study climate change impacts on the terrestrial biosphere.},

Fast growth of settlements and consequent ecological problems in urban zones necessitates application of advanced technologies like Remote Sensing to obtain detailed, upto date and accurate information about land use/land cover (LU/LC) status for management and planning of urban growth. This paper attempts to investigate the LU/LC changes in Dehradun city and associated changes in urban green cover over the period from 2004 to 2009.IRS P6 (LISS-IV) datasets of year 2004 and 2009 have been used. LU/LC of both years has been delineated using Maximum Likelihood Supervised classification technique. Classified maps were crossed to generate an urban green cover change map. Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) has been employed for detection of change areas and quantification of the amount of decline or increase in urban greenery. Results reveal that over the period of five years a significant decline has occurred in the extent of urban green spaces in Dehradun city with concomitant fragmentation resulting in considerable degradation of urban environment especially in southern parts of the city.},

  abstract = {Our study examines the urban vegetation – air temperature (Ta) – land surface temperature (LST) nexus at micro- and regional-scales to better understand urban climate dynamics and the uncertainty in using satellite-based LST for characterizing Ta. While vegetated cooling has been repeatedly linked to reductions in urban LST, the effects of vegetation on Ta, the quantity often used to characterize urban heat islands and global warming, and on the interactions between LST and Ta are less well characterized. To address this need we quantified summer temporal and spatial variation in Ta through a network of 300 air temperature sensors in three sub-regions of greater Los Angeles, CA, which spans a coastal to desert climate gradient. Additional sensors were placed within the inland sub-region at two heights (0.1 m and 2 m) within three groundcover types: bare soil, irrigated grass, and underneath citrus canopy. For the entire study region, we acquired new imagery data, which allowed calculation of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and LST. At the microscale, daytime Ta measured along a vertical gradient, ranged from 6 to 3 °C cooler at 0.1 and 2 m, underneath tall canopy compared to bare ground respectively. At the regional scale NDVI and LST were negatively correlated (p \&lt; 0.001). Relationships between diel variation in Ta and daytime LST at the regional scale were progressively weaker moving away from the coast and were generally limited to evening and nighttime hours. Relationships between NDVI and Ta were stronger during nighttime hours, yet effectiveness of mid-day vegetated cooling increased substantially at the most arid region. The effectiveness of vegetated Ta cooling increased during heat waves throughout the region. Our findings suggest an important but complex role of vegetation on LST and Ta and that vegetation may provide a negative feedback to urban climate warming. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The strict link between intra-annual vegetation dynamics (phenology) and Earth's climate makes phenological information fundamental to improve understanding and models of inter-annual variability in terrestrial carbon exchange and climate-biosphere interactions. In order to monitor phenology in a landscape characterized by heterogeneous features rapidly changing over the territory, we performed multitemporal classifications of NDVI-AVHRR data and interfaced them with Landsat-TM data and orography. The sample area is the Vulture basin (Southern Italy), where cultivated and densely vegetated areas coexist with urban and recently built industrial areas. These land cover patterns rapidly change over the territory at very small spatial scales; it is a complex zone very interesting for studying the use of remote sensing techniques in the integrated monitoring context. Clusters having homogeneous NDVI time behaviors were identified. In spite of its spatial resolution, AVHRR NDVI effectively picks up the characteristic phenology for different covers and altitudes. Moreover, some pixels having particular microclimate were clustered and their characterization was only possible by using orography and TM classification information. The comparison of two intra-annual classifications (1996 and 1998) showed that the proposed approach can be very useful for studying change in pattern of vegetation dynamics.},

  abstract = {High species diversity is argued to be the most important requisite for a resilient urban forest. In spite of this, there are many cities in the northern hemisphere that have very limited species diversity within their tree population. Consequently, there is an immense risk to urban canopy cover, if these over-used species succumb to serious pests or pathogens. Recognition of this should motivate the use of less commonly used species. Analysis of plant traits, such as the leaf water potential at turgor loss (ΨP0), can provide useful insights into a species’ capacity to grow in warm and dry urban environments. Therefore, the aim of this study was to evaluate ΨP0 of 45 tree species, the majority of which are rare in urban environments. To help evaluate the potential for using ΨP0 data to support future decision-making, a survey of professionals engaged with establishing trees in urban environments was also used to assess the relationship between the measured ΨP0 and the perceived drought tolerance of selected species. This study demonstrates that ΨP0 gives strong evidence for a species’ capacity to tolerate dry growing conditions and is a trait that varies substantially across species. Furthermore, ΨP0 was shown to closely relate to the experience of professionals involved in establishing trees in urban environments, thus providing evidence of its practical significance. Use of plant traits, such as ΨP0, should, therefore, give those specifying trees confidence to recommend non-traditional species for challenging urban environments.},

  abstract = {Abstract. We examine here the hypothesis that during flowering, the grass pollen concentrations at a specific site reflect the distribution of grass pollen sources within a few kilometres of this site. We perform this analysis on data from a measurement campaign in the city of Aarhus (Denmark) using three pollen traps and by comparing these observations with a novel inventory of grass pollen sources. The source inventory is based on a new methodology developed for urban-scale grass pollen sources. The new methodology is believed to be generally applicable for the European area, as it relies on commonly available remote sensing data combined with management information for local grass areas. The inventory has identified a number of grass pollen source areas present within the city domain. The comparison of the measured pollen concentrations with the inventory shows that the atmospheric concentrations of grass pollen in the urban zone reflect the source areas identified in the inventory, and that the pollen sources that are found to affect the pollen levels are located near or within the city domain. The results also show that during days with peak levels of pollen concentrations there is no correlation between the three urban traps and an operational trap located just 60 km away. This finding suggests that during intense flowering, the grass pollen concentration mirrors the local source distribution and is thus a local-scale phenomenon. Model simulations aimed at assessing population exposure to pollen levels are therefore recommended to take into account both local sources and local atmospheric transport, and not to rely only on describing regional to long-range transport of pollen. The derived pollen source inventory can be entered into local-scale atmospheric transport models in combination with other components that simulate pollen release in order to calculate urban-scale variations in the grass pollen load. The gridded inventory with a resolution of 14 m is therefore made available as supplementary material to this paper, and the verifying grass pollen observations are additionally available in tabular form.},

  abstract = {Presence of invasive alien plant species in urban areas has become an issue throughout the globe. City administrations are making efforts to avoid invasions, to eradicate and/or control invasive species, or alternatively, try to process them into useful products. To monitor the spread of species over a region, it is important to map invasive species. In the scope of the APPLAUSE project, we have developed a One-Class support vector machine (SVM) approach to detect invasive species from individual aerial and multiple Sentinel-2 satellite images over the City of Ljubljana (Slovenia). In this paper, we focus specifically on the detection of Japanese knotweed, because it produces large stands and is therefore the most detectable invasive species in the studied area. The proposed SVM approach uses red-green-blue (RGB) band composites and infrared (IR) bands as input data for aerial images, while for satellite images additionally normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) are used. In the study, we used ground truth data collected by experts both as training and as validation data. On aerial images, we first perform segmentation, which is followed by two One-Class SVM classifications. On these classification outputs, we use K-means algorithm on the IR band, which groups the samples and removes the ones that were falsely recognized as Japanese knotweed. Merging the results together and masking out small samples and areas where Japanese knotweed is not present, we get the final result. On satellite data the approach is similar; the only difference is the usage of multiple input images from different acquisition dates for SVM classification. For detection of Japanese knotweed from the aerial images the accuracy was 83\%, and 90\% for stands larger than 100 m2 on satellite data. The results demonstrate that the applied methodology with the qualitative ground truth data can be used operationally for automatic detection of Japanese knotweed on the municipality level. © Smerdu et al.},

Methods are needed for monitoring canopy development that can be replicated on a large-scale, while retaining fine-scale resolution at the level of individual trees. Citizen science has the potential to provide this, but a range of approaches exist in terms of the phenophase recorded (e.g. budburst or leaf expansion), how the phenophase is characterised (first events or intensity monitoring) and the portion of tree crown assessed and observation frequency. A comparison of spring budburst and leaf expansion of four tree species (Fraxinus excelsior, Fagus sylvatica, Quercus robur and Acer pseudoplatanus) was monitored in one woodland using (1) counts of expanded leaves on three crown sections, (2) percentage estimates of expanded leaves across the whole crown and (3) a greenness index from photography. Logistic growth models were applied to make comparisons. First-event dates were found to be misleading due to high variation in leaf development rates within and between species. Percentage estimates and counts produced similar estimates of leaf expansion timing and rate. The greenness index produced similar estimates of timing, but not rate, and was compromised by practicalities of photographing individual crowns in closed-canopy woodland. Citizen scientists could collect data across the period of spring leafing, with visual counts and/or estimates made every 3–4~days, subject to tests of reliability in pilot citizen science studies.},

  abstract = {Many aspects of the urban environment have the potential to affect tree growth and physiology in forest patches, including higher temperatures, elevated CO2 concentrations, and modified soil biogeochemistry from increased nutrient and heavy metal inputs. However, these changes in tree growth are likely to vary by species and across urban areas, reflecting the local environmental conditions associated with the idiosyncratic trajectory of development in a city. Here, we examine growth rates of two dominant native tree species (white oak (Quercus alba L.) and red maple (Acer rubrum L.)) across urban and reference forest sites of three major cities in the eastern United States (New York, NY (NYC); Philadelphia, PA; and Baltimore, MD). We also characterized soil physical and chemical properties around each tree and monitored air temperature over three growing seasons at each site. Throughout the growing season, the urban sites had consistently warmer daytime and nighttime temperatures than reference sites. Urban forest patch soils also had elevated calcium, magnesium, and heavy metal concentrations compared to reference forest soils. Urban vs. reference tree growth rates varied by species, by city, and over time. Despite differences in the two native species’ ecophysiology, both grew more rapidly in the urban environment than at nearby reference sites, particularly in recent decades. Over the entire 145-year tree ring record analyzed, white oak basal area increment was significantly higher in urban trees compared to reference trees. Changes in the relative production of white oak earlywood and latewood between site types in each city and over time may relate to precipitation patterns. Perhaps due to their ability to persist in a wide variety of environmental conditions, mature trees of both species appear to be acclimating to urban forest patch conditions of the eastern U.S. and in some cases are experiencing enhanced growth rates compared to trees in nearby reference forests. An understanding of past and present growth rates of trees in urban forest patches can provide insight into future ecosystem functioning of these urban green spaces as well as that of more rural ecosystems experiencing environmental change factors similar to those associated with urbanization.},

  abstract = {: Under changing climatic conditions, drought may become a critical constraint for trees in urban areas, particularly at roadsides and highly paved squares. As healthy urban trees have proven to be an important mitigation and adaptation tool for climate change as well as a significant provider of ecosystem services, there is a need for planting species and cultivars capable of coping with the limited water supply. However, data on species’ and cultivars’ response to drought, particularly their water supplying root systems remains rare. To consider the whole plant responses to drought situations, we studied the growth and phenology of three frequently planted tree species and cultivars with a diameter of 5–6 cm during a one-year rainfall exclusion experiment conducted in a nursery field as well as the dry biomass of the compartments branch, stem, and root after excavation. Our results revealed that species’ and cultivars’ performance were linked to their within-plant carbon partitioning. A high tolerance to drought was noted for Acer campestre, with a particularly high ratio of root:shoot ratio, which made it presumably less susceptible to droughts. Tilia cordata ‘Greenspire’ was highly affected by the reduced water availability visible through prematurely leaf senescence, while Carpinus betulus ‘Fastigiata’ suffered from losing a considerable part of its root biomass, which resulted in the lowest root:shoot ratio of all species and cultivars. This study demonstrated the need for investigating the reaction patterns of species and cultivars by considering both the above-and the below-ground plant parts. We recommend that, for future tree plantings at harsh and challenging urban sites, an important selection criterion should be species’ and cultivars’ capability to develop and retain strong and dense root systems even under limited water supply, as that is believed to be an important trait for drought tolerance.},

  abstract = {Urban vegetation can influence local air temperatures through its biophysical effects on surface energy balance. These effects produce gradients (ΔTa) between air temperature of vegetation spaces (Tveg) and air temperature of open spaces (Topen) (ΔTa=Tveg−Topen), hereafter referred to as vegetation cooling (negative values of ΔTa) and warming (positive values of ΔTa), respectively. But vegetation cooling or warming highly depends on background climate of urban areas as well as on vegetation states. Field observations are usually restricted to one or few cities, setting limitations to a general understanding. In this study, a synthetic analysis of 3634 point-scale in-situ observations from 77 global sites in 35 cites was conducted using the bootstrap sampling and hierarchical partitioning methods. Results show that vegetation cooling is generally stronger during the daytime periods, in warm seasons, at low latitude zones, for forest lands and at leaf growth stage, while vegetation warming usually occurs in the opposite contexts. Urban vegetation begins to exert considerable cooling effects when the daily mean background air temperature (BAT) is \&gt;10.0 °C, but on average has a slight warming effect when BAT is \&lt;10.0 °C. Besides, vegetation cooling increases sharply when evapotranspiration is \&gt;61.7 mm/month or when area of urban vegetation is \&gt;35.2 ha. Plant growth stages (i.e., canopy leaf growth, senescence and dormancy stages) (37.6 ± 0.11\%), a vegetation phenology proxy, acts as the primary biotic factor, while seasonality (23.0 ± 0.11\%) and latitude (11.4 ± 0.07\%) that control the background climate are two most important abiotic contributors. Our findings suggest approximate thresholds for distinguishing vegetation cooling/warming effects and provide helpful information for future urban greenspace planning aimed at mitigating local climate warming. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Phenology, the timing of cyclical and seasonal natural phenomena such as flowering and leaf out, is an integral part of ecological systems with impacts on human activities like environmental management, tourism, and agriculture. As a result, there are numerous potential applications for actionable predictions of when phenological events will occur. However, despite the availability of phenological data with large spatial, temporal, and taxonomic extents, and numerous phenology models, there have been no automated species-level forecasts of plant phenology. This is due in part to the challenges of building a system that integrates large volumes of climate observations and forecasts, uses that data to fit models and make predictions for large numbers of species, and consistently disseminates the results of these forecasts in interpretable ways. Here, we describe a new near-term phenology-forecasting system that makes predictions for the timing of budburst, flowers, ripe fruit, and fall colors for 78 species across the United States up to 6 months in advance and is updated every four days. We use the lessons learned in developing this system to provide guidance developing large-scale near-term ecological forecast systems more generally, to help advance the use of automated forecasting in ecology.},

  abstract = {Temperature is one of the most important factors controlling the phenology of winter wheat. Rapid urbanization in China dramatically modifies the microclimate, especially temperature, surrounding cities. However, it is unclear whether such urban-induced changes in microclimate can influence the phenology of winter wheat and whether the influence is consistent across cities of different sizes. Here, we investigated the urban-induced microclimate effects on winter wheat spring phenology (i.e., the regreen-up date, RGUD) in three cities spanning a range of sizes in northern China. These three cities include Shijiazhuang (350.98 km2), Baoding (118.95 km2), and Linqing (55.12 km2), and the key data for this study are Sentinel-2 images. Based on the Sentinel-2 images, we first calculated a vegetation index (normalized difference phenology index, NDPI), and then extracted winter wheat RGUD. Finally, we analyzed the distribution of the RGUD along an urban-rural gradient using buffers surrounding the urban areas. Our study has three main results: (1) The RGUD shows a significant increasing trend along the urban-rural gradients in both Shijiazhuang and Baoding, suggesting that urban-induced increases in temperature indeed advance the spring phenology of winter wheat. (2) The maximum influence size of the urban-induced temperature effects on the RGUD is positively correlated with city size, i.e., 27 km for Shijiazhuang, 14 km for Baoding and 7 km for Linqing. (3) The change rate of the RGUD with distance along the urban-rural gradient is significantly higher in the large city (Shijiazhuang: 0.26 day/km) than it is in the middle- and small-scale cities (Baoding: 0.21 day/km and Linqing: 0.11 day/km), which suggests that larger cities spread heat at a faster rate than that of smaller cities. This study suggests that the planting and management of winter wheat surrounding cities should consider the influence of city size to optimize yields. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Urban trees provide social, economic, environmental and ecosystem services benefits that improve the liveability of cities and contribute to individual and community wellbeing. There is thus a need for effective mapping, monitoring and maintenance of urban trees. Remote sensing technologies can effectively map and monitor urban tree coverage and changes over time as an efficient and low-cost alternative to field-based measurements, which are time consuming and costly. Automatic extraction of urban land cover features with high accuracy is a challenging task, and it demands object based artificial intelligence workflows for efficiency and thematic accuracy. The aim of this research is to effectively map urban tree cover changes and model the relationship of such changes with socioeconomic variables. The object-based convolutional neural network (CNN) method is illustrated by mapping urban tree cover changes between 2005 and 2015/16 using satellite, Google Earth imageries and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) datasets. The training sample for CNN model was generated by Object Based Image Analysis (OBIA) using thresholds in a Canopy Height Model (CHM) and the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The tree heatmap produced from the CNN model was further refined using OBIA. Tree cover loss, gain and persistence was extracted, and multiple regression analysis was applied to model the relationship with socioeconomic variables. The overall accuracy and kappa coefficient of tree cover extraction was 96\% and 0.77 for 2005 images and 98\% and 0.93 for 2015/16 images, indicating that the object-based CNN technique can be effectively implemented for urban tree coverage mapping and monitoring. There was a decline in tree coverage in all suburbs. Mean parcel size and median household income were significantly related to tree cover loss (R2 = 58.5\%). Tree cover gain and persistence had positive relationship with tertiary education, parcel size and ownership change (gain: R2 = 67.8\% and persistence: R2 = 75.3\%). The research findings demonstrated that remote sensing data with intelligent processing can contribute to the development of policy input for management of tree coverage in cities. © 2020 by the authors.},

We identified 48 instruments and 13 platforms with multiple instruments that are of broad interest to the environmental sciences that either collected data in the 2000s, were recently launched, or are planned for launch in this decade. We have restricted our review to instruments that primarily observe terrestrial landscapes or coastal margins and are available under free and open data policies. We focused on imagers that passively measure wavelengths in the reflected solar and emitted thermal spectrum. The suite of instruments we describe measure land surface characteristics, including land cover, but provide a more detailed monitoring of ecosystems, plant communities, and even some species then possible from historic sensors. The newer instruments have potential to greatly improve our understanding of ecosystem functional relationships among plant traits like leaf mass area (LMA), total nitrogen content, and leaf area index (LAI). They provide new information on physiological processes related to photosynthesis, transpiration and respiration, and stress detection, including capabilities to measure key plant and soil biophysical properties. These include canopy and soil temperature and emissivity, chlorophyll fluorescence, and biogeochemical contents like photosynthetic pigments (e.g., chlorophylls, carotenoids, and phycobiliproteins from cyanobacteria), water, cellulose, lignin, and nitrogen in foliar proteins. These data will enable us to quantify and characterize various soil properties such as iron content, several types of soil clays, organic matter, and other components. Most of these satellites are in low Earth orbit (LEO), but we include a few in geostationary orbit (GEO) because of their potential to measure plant physiological traits over diurnal periods, improving estimates of water and carbon budgets. We also include a few spaceborne active LiDAR and radar imagers designed for quantifying surface topography, changes in surface structure, and 3-dimensional canopy properties such as height, area, vertical profiles, and gap structure. We provide a description of each instrument and tables to summarize their characteristics. Lastly, we suggest instrument synergies that are likely to yield improved results when data are combined. © 2021, The Author(s).},

As interest in these datasets increases, we need additional information regarding the effect of different approaches on the scale of observations and camera field of view. In this research, we examine the impact of field of view on the capacity of cameras to detect changes in phenology of individual species in an image time series. We examine two co-located series of oblique images acquired using a fine and broad field of view and compare a number of phenological indicators, including the start and end of season derived for individual plant species. Our results indicate both fine and broad field of view camera systems are highly effective at detecting key markers of plant phenology with no significant differences between the two. This result supports environmental monitoring using cost-effective broad field of view cameras, or even—subject to some constraints—readily available camera stations installed for tourism or traffic monitoring.},

We examined patterns of land surface phenology (LSP) throughout the U.S. Great Plains region, which contains diverse metropolitan areas embedded within a predominately agricultural landscape. We assembled a time series (2002-2012) of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Nadir BRDF-Adjusted Reflectance (NBAR) data and land surface temperature data at 500m and 1000m spatial resolution, respectively. We derived measures of the vegetated land surface and the thermal regime of the growing season at 8-day intervals using the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Accumulated Growing Degree-Days (AGDD). Fitting the convex quadratic LSP model of NDVI as a function of AGDD yielded two phenometrics - Peak NDVI and Thermal Time to Peak - and one model fit metric - the adjusted coefficient of determination (r2¡inf¿adj¡/inf¿) - for each pixel per growing season. We linked the phenometrics with impervious surface area (ISA) data extracted from the U.S. Geological Survey National Land Cover Dataset (NLCD) to characterize differences in timing and amplitude of peak greenness between urban areas and their surrounding landscapes. Our results reveal the broad control of climatic conditions and moisture availability on phenological patterns across urban to rural gradients, with drier, southern cities displaying more varied responses of peak greenness timing and amplitude to urban intensity. © 2015.},

  abstract = {Continuous urban expansion and its influence on land surface phenology (LSP) have been gaining considerable attention due to their impacts on climate change, carbon cycling and human health. Most previous studies have investigated the effects of urbanization on LSP from the regional to global scales by using coarse-resolution remotely sensed images and fixed land cover boundary maps. However, the influences of urbanization on LSP are also important at the local level, particularly in and around rapidly urbanizing cities as LSP is closely linked to the local ecology and people's health. To analyze the dynamic of urbanization and its effect on LSP at the local scale, this study proposed a novel framework of characterizing LSP with consideration of continuous urban expansion based on all available time-series Landsat and Moderate Resolution Image Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Reflectance and Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) composite data. The proposed approach was capable of evaluating LSP impacts of urbanization from three aspects: 1) the phenology difference between dynamic annual urban and rural areas; 2) the different rates of phenology trend between the permanent urban and rural areas; and 3) the phenology shifts in the areas that were urbanized during the period. This approach was applied to Nanjing, China and the experimental results indicated that when compared with the rural areas, the phenology cycle started 0.59 ± 0.58 days earlier (start of season, SOS) and ended 1.65 ± 1.55 days later (end of season, EOS) in urban areas, accordingly leading to increased growing season length (GSL) by 2.77 ± 2.61 days. Besides, the experiments also revealed that 70.81\% SOS and 78.79\% EOS in the permanent urban-rural areas were provided with delayed phenology trends, along with 80.72\% of these regions tending to have a prolonged GSL. Furthermore, the rates of SOS and EOS delay in rural areas were 0.12 ± 0.12 day/year and 0.02 ± 0.02 day/year faster than those in urban areas, and the rate of GSL prolonging in urban regions was 0.04 ± 0.04 day/year faster than that in rural counterparts. For the urbanized regions in Nanjing, after experiencing conversion to the impervious surface, SOS and EOS delayed in 65.77\% and 70.33\% of the regions, accompanied by extended GSL in 70.83\% of the regions. Overall, this research proposed a novel approach of analyzing urbanization implications for LSP at the city scale and demonstrated its priority of taking continuous land cover change into account. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

  abstract = {Cities in arid and semi-arid regions have been exploring urban sustainability policies, such as lowering the vegetation coverage to reduce residential outdoor water use. Meanwhile, urban residents express concerns that such policies could potentially impact home prices regardless of the reduced water costs because studies have shown that there is a positive correlation between vegetation coverage and home values. On the other hand, lower vegetation coverage in arid and semi-arid desert regions could increase surface temperatures, and consequently increases energy costs. The question is therefore where the point in which residential outdoor water use can be minimized without overly increasing surface temperatures and negatively impacting home values. This study examines the impacts of spatial composition of different vegetation types on land surface temperature (LST), outdoor water use (OWU), and property sales value (PSV) in 302 local residential communities in the Phoenix metropolitan area, Arizona using remotely sensed data and regression analysis. In addition, the spatial composition of vegetation cover was optimized to achieve a relatively lower LST and OWU and maintain a relatively higher PSV at the same time. We found that drought-tolerant landscaping that is composed of mostly shrubs and trees adapted to the desert environment is the most water efficient way to reduce LST, but grass contributes to a higher PSV. Research findings suggest that different residential landscaping strategies may be better suited for different neighborhoods and goal sets can be used by urban planners and city managers to better design urban residential landscaping for more efficient water conservation and urban heat mitigation for desert cities. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Online map services like Google Maps or Here Maps provide direct access to huge amounts of densely sampled, georeferenced images from street view and aerial perspective. There is an opportunity to design computer vision systems that will help us search, catalog and monitor public infrastructure, buildings and artifacts. We explore the architecture and feasibility of such a system. The main technical challenge is combining test time information from multiple views of each geographic location (e.g., aerial and street views). We implement two modules: det2geo, which detects the set of locations of objects belonging to a given category, and geo2cat, which computes the fine-grained category of the object at a given location. We introduce a solution that adapts state-ofthe-art CNN-based object detectors and classifiers. We test our method on “Pasadena Urban Trees”, a new dataset of 80,000 trees with geographic and species annotations, and show that combining multiple views significantly improves both tree detection and tree species classification, rivaling human performance.},

Many types of tree pollen are considered to be allergens and have been linked to various manifestations of allergic disease, including allergic sensitization, exacerbation of allergic rhinitis, and exacerbation of allergic asthma. An emerging body of literature suggests that the amount of pollen deposited annually varies widely over small spatial scales. While the health impacts of spatial variation in tree pollen within metropolitan areas could be large, the current literature has not been systematically reviewed. To fill this gap in knowledge, this review synthesizes existing evidence on how tree pollen is distributed on an intra-urban spatial scale. A better understanding of the spatial distribution of allergenic tree pollen within urban environments and its relation to health could inform increasingly common urban tree planting programs.},

Little is known about how tree pollen levels vary within cities and whether such variation affects the development or exacerbation of allergic disease. Accordingly, we collected integrated pollen samples at uniform height at 45 sites across New York City during the 2013 pollen season. We used these monitoring results in combination with adjacent land use data to develop a land use regression model for tree pollen. We evaluated four types of land use variables for inclusion in the model: tree canopy, distributed building height (a measure of building volume density), elevation, and distance to water. When included alone in the model, percent tree canopy cover within a 0.5\,km radial buffer explained 39\% of the variance in tree pollen (1.9\% increase in tree pollen per one-percentage point increase in tree canopy cover, P{$<$}0.0001). The inclusion of additional variables did not improve model fit. We conclude that intra-urban variation in tree canopy is an important driver of tree pollen exposure. Land use regression models can be used to incorporate spatial variation in tree pollen exposure in studies of allergic disease outcomes.},

The delineation of individual trees in remote sensing images is an essential task in forest analysis. Here we introduce a new Python package, DeepForest that detects individual trees in high resolution RGB imagery using deep learning. While deep learning has proven highly effective in a range of computer vision tasks, it requires large amounts of training data that are typically difficult to obtain in ecological studies. DeepForest overcomes this limitation by including a model pretrained on over 30 million algorithmically generated crowns from 22 forests and fine-tuned using 10,000 hand-labelled crowns from six forests. The package supports the application of this general model to new data, fine tuning the model to new datasets with user labelled crowns, training new models and evaluating model predictions. This simplifies the process of using and retraining deep learning models for a range of forests, sensors and spatial resolutions. We illustrate the workflow of DeepForest using data from the National Ecological Observatory Network, a tropical forest in French Guiana, and street trees from Portland, Oregon.},

The increasing concentration of people in cities results in larger populations being exposed to allergenic pollen at the same time. There is almost no information about spatial distribution of pollen within cities as well as a lack of information about the possible impact to human health. To obtain this increasing need for pollen exposure studies on an intra-urban scale, a novelty screening network of 14 weekly changed pollen traps was established within a large metropolitan area—Berlin, Germany. Gravimetric pollen traps were placed at a uniform street-level height from March until October 2014. Three important allergenic pollen types for Central Europe—birch (Betula), grasses (Poaceae), and mugwort (Artemisia)—were monitored. Remarkable spatial and temporal variations of pollen sedimentation within the city and the influences by urban local sources are shown. The observed differences between the trap with the overall highest and the trap with the overall lowest amount of pollen sedimentation were in the case of birch pollen 245\%, grass pollen 306\%, and mugwort pollen 1962\%. Differences of this magnitude can probably lead to different health impacts on allergy sufferers in one city. Therefore, pollen should be monitored preferably in two or more appropriate locations within large cities and as a part of natural air quality regulations.},

  abstract = {Large spatial differences in the distribution of three allergologically relevant pollen types for Central Europe—birch, grass, and mugwort—are revealed within a large metropolitan area—Berlin, Germany. The purpose of the study is an examination of the hypothesis that these different pollen exposure conditions can cause different degrees of pollen-induced symptoms within the city. Pollen data from 14 gravimetric traps and one volumetric trap in Berlin and anonymously reported pollen-induced symptom data from the online-based self-documentation tool “Patient’s Hayfever Diary” (PHD) are used for the analysis of temporal and spatial variations of the severity of the overall total symptoms. Geographically localised symptom data are linked to the nearest pollen trap. Statistical analysis is performed using Kendall’s Tau-b. Higher amounts of monitored birch and grass pollen in the peripheral areas of Berlin induce stronger symptoms in PHD users located within suburbs than those located in the city centre. There is no statistical relationship between the varying presence of mugwort pollen in the air and the severity of symptoms. Spatial differences in the pollen-induced symptom severity within a large city coinciding with spatial differences in birch and grass pollen depositions are shown for the first time. Therefore, pollen data from a single trap may not provide an appropriate explanation for differences in pollen-induced symptoms across the city. More detailed and reliable information about the exposure to allergenic pollen can be addressed by installing further traps in order to improve the knowledge about pollen exposure within cities.},

  abstract = {Lindens belong to valued trees that are frequently planted in urban green areas. Nevertheless, during their flowering they can pose a risk to sensitive people in cities due to their allergenic pollen. This paper presents the results of a 3-year phenological study (2016–2018) and an 18-year aerobiological study (2001–2018) conducted in Lublin (Poland). The flowering phenology data for the following five species: T. americana, T. cordata, T. × euchlora, T. platyphyllos, and T. tomentosa, were compared with the data regarding Tilia pollen seasons. It was shown that the largest amounts of airborne Tilia pollen grains occur during the full flowering period of T. cordata and that the flowering sequence of the linden species studied is constant during the growing season: T. platyphyllos, T. americana, T. cordata, T. × euchlora, and T. tomentosa. We found pollen seasons to start earlier by 14 days and to be extended by 15 days. Throughout the study period, the annual Tilia pollen sum did not change significantly. However, in 2018 in which there was a significant increase in temperature above the average for the previous 17 years, flowering and pollen release distinctly accelerated, and the annual pollen sum increased more than three times compared to the average for the previous 17 years. In central-eastern Poland, the risk of pollen allergy due to the presence of Tilia pollen occurs in May, June, and July. We recorded the highest linden pollen concentrations in June. Due to the acceleration of flowering and pollen release in linden trees as a result of global warming, the incidence of pollen allergy in central Europe can be expected to become more intense already in the second half of May. Therefore, linden plantings in new urban green areas should be planned to be established at some distance from residential estates. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH},

  abstract = {We used a 10-year record (1990-99) of composited and cloud-screened reflectances from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) to test for phenological differences between urban and rural areas in the eastern United States deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF). We hypothesized that well-documented urban heat island effects would be associated with alterations in temperature-sensitive vegetation phenology. Our objectives were thus (a) to investigate possible differences in the start of the growing season (SOS) and end of the growing season (EOS) between the urban and DBF land covers, (b) to investigate related differences in greenness amplitude and fractional cover, and (c) to develop a generalized additive model (GAM) to predict the spatial variation of observed differences. By analyzing individual 1° latitude by 1° longitude blocks, we found that, on average, urbanization is associated with a growing season expansion of 7.6 days. Most of this effect is caused by an earlier SOS in urban areas. In all cases, urban regions had lower fractional cover and greenness amplitude. The GAM model failed to produce a viable model for differences in EOS, probably because it is dominated by photoperiod controls with only a minor temperature impact. SOS differences were predicted with an accuracy of about 2.4 days, with a GAM consisting of smoothed functions of mean annual average temperature, urban fractional cover, and the urban vs DBF greenness amplitude difference. We speculate that evidence of a phenological response to warming indicates that global warming, without reduction in DBF vegetation cover and greenness amplitude, may increase carbon sequestration in mesic deciduous forests.},

  abstract = {Remote sensing of vegetation phenology is an important method with which to monitor terrestrial responses to climate change, but most approaches include signals from multiple forcings, such as mixed phenological signals from multiple biomes, urbanization, political changes, shifts in agricultural practices, and disturbances. Consequently, it is difficult to extract a clear signal from the usually assumed forcing: climate change. Here, using global 8 km 1982 to 1999 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data and an eight-element monthly climatology, we identified pixels whose wavelet power spectrum was consistently dominated by annual cycles and then created phenologically and climatically self-similar clusters, which we term phenoregions. We then ranked and screened each phenoregion as a function of landcover homogeneity and consistency, evidence of human impacts, and political diversity. Remaining phenoregions represented areas with a minimized probability of non-climatic forcings and form elemental units for long-term phenological monitoring.

  abstract = {Remote sensing of vegetation phenology is an important method with which to monitor terrestrial responses to climate change, but most approaches include signals from multiple forcings, such as mixed phenological signals from multiple biomes, urbanization, political changes, shifts in agricultural practices, and disturbances. Consequently, it is difficult to extract a clear signal from the usually assumed forcing: climate change. Here, using global 8 km 1982 to 1999 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data and an eight-element monthly climatology, we identified pixels whose wavelet power spectrum was consistently dominated by annual cycles and then created phenologically and climatically self-similar clusters, which we term phenoregions. We then ranked and screened each phenoregion as a function of landcover homogeneity and consistency, evidence of human impacts, and political diversity. Remaining phenoregions represented areas with a minimized probability of non-climatic forcings and form elemental units for long-term phenological monitoring.

  abstract = {Climate change has brought renewed interest in the study of plant phenology – the timing of life history events. Data on shifting phenologies with warming have accumulated rapidly, yet research has been comparatively slow to explain the diversity of phenological responses observed across latitudes, growing seasons and species. Here, we outline recent efforts to synthesize perspectives on plant phenology across the fields of ecology, climate science and evolution. We highlight three major axes that vary among these disciplines: relative focus on abiotic versus biotic drivers of phenology, on plastic versus genetic drivers of intraspecific variation, and on cross-species versus autecological approaches. Recent interdisciplinary efforts, building on data covering diverse species and climate space, have found a greater role of temperature in controlling phenology at higher latitudes and for early-flowering species in temperate systems. These efforts have also made progress in understanding the tremendous diversity of responses across species by incorporating evolutionary relatedness, and linking phenological flexibility to invasions and plant performance. Future research with a focus on data collection in areas outside the temperate mid-latitudes and across species' ranges, alongside better integration of how risk and investment shape plant phenology, offers promise for further progress.},

Following this, we retrieved vegetation cover data from the Chongqing area between 2001 and 2010 using this dataset, applying a dimidiate pixel method. We then used several analytical indices to analyze spatial and temporal changes and trends related to these changes. We determined that a reconstruction of the MODIS NDVI dataset using asymmetric Gaussian fitting in conjunction with a data quality weight coefficient improved data quality and created a foundation for accurate estimations of vegetation cover. We also determined that vegetation cover in the Chongqing area decreased gradually from east to west. During the 10-year study period, vegetation cover in the Chongqing area generally increased, changing from low to high coverage. This increase in vegetation cover was mainly the result of ecological protection policies and improving climate conditions. We also found that changes in vegetation cover were mainly the result of urban construction and afforestation initiatives, but vegetation cover improved overall. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

  abstract = {The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) is a powerful tool for understanding past vegetation, monitoring the current state, and predicting its future. Due to technological and budget limitations, the existing global NDVI time-series data cannot simultaneously meet the needs of high spatial and temporal resolution. This study proposes a high spatiotemporal resolution NDVI fusion model based on histogram clustering (NDVI\textsubscript{F}MHC), which uses a new spatiotemporal fusion framework to predict phenological and shape changes. Meanwhile, this model also uses four strategies to reduce error, including the construction of an overdetermined linear mixed model, multiscale prediction, residual distribution, and Gaussian filtering. Five groups of real MODIS\textsubscript{N}DVI and Landsat\textsubscript{N}DVI datasets were used to verify the predictive performance of the NDVI\textsubscript{F}MHC. The results indicate that NDVI\textsubscript{F}MHC has higher accuracy and robustness in forest areas (r = 0.9488 and ADD = 0.0229) and cultivated land areas (r = 0.9493 and ADD = 0.0605), while the prediction effect is relatively weak in areas subject to shape changes, such as flooded areas (r = 0.8450 and ADD = 0.0968), urban areas (r = 0.8855 and ADD = 0.0756), and fire areas (r = 0.8417 and ADD = 0.0749). Compared with ESTARFM, NDVI\textsubscript{L}MGM, and FSDAF, NDVI\textsubscript{F}MHC has the highest prediction accuracy, the best spatial detail retention, and the strongest ability to capture shape changes. Therefore, the NDVI\textsubscript{F}MHC can obtain NDVI time-series data with high spatiotemporal resolution, which can be used to realize long-term land surface dynamic process research in a complex environment. © 2020 by the authors.

The air temperature within 20 ∼ 80 days and especially 20 ∼ 40 days before flowering had a significant effect on the outset of flowering, 1. e., an increasing temperature in spring could advance the outset of flowering. Both sprouting and leaf expansion were negatively correlated with cold index (CI), but no significant correlation was observed between the outset of flowering and CI. An increase of mean annual air temperature by 1 °C would advance the outset of sprouting by 9 days, leaf expansion by 10 days, and outset of flowering by 5 days.},

  abstract = {In last 40 years (1960-2005), the spring phenology of Shenyang urban forest was affected by global warming. The mean annual air temperature of Shenyang had an overall increase, with the increment being 0.96 °C. Before 1982, it was relative cold and the maximal of the decrease was 1.95 °C ; while after 1982, it was relative warm and the maximal increment was 1.60 °C. The air temperature was increased in the whole year, with the maximal increment in winter (2.3 °C) and spring (1.35 °C). The spring phenological phase of main tree species in Shenyang urban forest presented itself later in relatively cold period, but in advance in the relatively warm period. The dates of the beginning and ending of the spring phenological phase had a close synchronous relationship, and correlated negatively with the length of the seasonal rhythm of phenology. There was a significant negative correlation between the date of budding and the air temperature in winter and early spring. The higher the air temperature in winter and early spring, the earlier the tree budded. The date of sprouting new leaves was mainly affected by the air temperature in spring and had less correlation with the temperature in winter, while that of early flowering was mainly affected by the air temperature 20-80 days (especially 20-40 days) before early flowering. Coldness index (CI) had significant positive correlations with the dates of budding and sprouting new leaves, but less correlation with the date of early flowering. It was predicted that under the conditions of elevated CO2 concentration and air temperature, the dates of budding, sprouting new leaves, and early flowering of the main tree species in Shenyang urban forest would be advanced for 40.41, 43.08, and 24.13 days, respectively.},

  abstract = {Urban ecological status is closely related to the quality of human life. Timely, precisely and objectively understanding urban ecological status has become an increasing concern in the world. To meet this requirement, this paper develops a remote sensing based ecological index (RSEI) for the measure of urban ecology. As an index for the assessment of urban ecological status, the RSEI aims to integrate four important ecological indicators which are frequently used in evaluating urban ecology. These are greenness, wetness, dryness, and heat. The four indicators can be represented respectively by four remote sensing indices or components, which are the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), normalized difference built-up and soil index (NDBSI), wetness component of the tasseled cap transformation (Wet), and land surface temperature (LST). Instead of a simple addition or weighted addition of the four indicators, the principal component analysis (PCA) was utilized to compress the four indicators into one to construct the index for assessing overall urban ecological status. After careful comparison of the four principal components (PC1 to PC4) derived from the four indicators, the first principal component (PC1) was found to have integrated most of the information of the four indicators. This suggested that the PC1 can more effectively represent the four indicators than any of the other three components, i.e., PC2, PC3 and PC4. Accordingly, the new index, RSEI, was formed using the PC1 derived from the four factors and thus can measure greenness, wetness, dryness and heat of an urban ecosystem. Obviously, the RSEI is entirely based on remote sensing data and mostly on natural ecological factors. The calculation of the index is totally free of artificial interference, such as assigning a threshold value or weight value during the computing procedure. Therefore, the RSEI can assess the urban ecological status more objectively and easily. With the change detection technique, the proposed index can also be used to monitor the change of the ecological status of an urban area between different years. In practice, the index was successfully applied in a multi-temporal ecological status assessment of Fuzhou' s urban area in Fujian province, southeastern China. Results show that Fuzhou has witnessed ecological degradation during the study period from 2001 to 2009. This is indicated by a decline of the RSEI value from 0. 579 in 2001 to 0. 529 in 2009. The fast expansion of the Fuzhou's urban area was attributed to the ecological degradation in the study duration, which caused the increase in NDBSI and LST and the decrease in NDVI and Wet. This in turn resulted in the decline of the RSEI as the index is the function of the four factors. Nevertheless, a RSEI-based change detection has revealed that the ecological quality of the urban center of Fuzhou was improved in spite of the overall ecological degradation in the urban area during the study years.},

  abstract = {Background: Plant leaves, as the main photosynthetic organs and the high energy converters among primary producers in terrestrial ecosystems, have attracted significant research attention. Leaf lifespan is an adaptive characteristic formed by plants to obtain the maximum carbon in the long-term adaption process. It determines important functional and structural characteristics exhibited in the environmental adaptation of plants. However, the leaf lifespan and leaf characteristics of urban forests were not studied up to now. Methods: By using statistic, linear regression methods and correlation analysis, leaf phenological characters of main tree species in urban forest of Shenyang were observed for five years to obtain the leafing phenology (including leafing start time, end time, and duration), defoliating phenology (including defoliation start time, end time, and duration), and the leaf lifespan of the main tree species. Moreover, the relationships between temperature and leafing phenology, defoliating phenology, and leaf lifespan were analyzed. Findings: The timing of leafing differed greatly among species. The early leafing species would have relatively early end of leafing; the longer it took to the end of leafing would have a later time of completed leafing. The timing of defoliation among different species varied significantly, the early defoliation species would have relatively longer duration of defoliation. If the mean temperature rise for 1°C in spring, the time of leafing would experience 5 days earlier in spring. If the mean temperature decline for 1°C, the time of defoliation would experience 3 days delay in autumn. Interpretation: There is significant correlation between leaf longevity and the time of leafing and defoliation. According to correlation analysis and regression analysis, there is significant correlation between temperature and leafing and defoliation phenology. Early leafing species would have a longer life span and consequently have advantage on carbon accumulation compared with later defoliation species. © 2014 Xu et al.},

  abstract = {The real-time, accurate, and refined monitoring of urban green space status information is of great significance in the construction of urban ecological environment and the improvement of urban ecological benefits. The high-resolution technology can provide abundant information of ground objects, which makes the information of urban green surface more complicated. The existing classification methods are challenging to meet the classification accuracy and automation requirements of high-resolution images. This paper proposed a deep learning classification method for urban green space based on phenological features constraints in order to make full use of the spectral and spatial information of green space provided by high-resolution remote sensing images (GaoFen-2) in different periods. The vegetation phenological features were added as auxiliary bands to the deep learning network for training and classification. We used the HRNet (High-Resolution Network) as our model and introduced the Focal Tversky Loss function to solve the sample imbalance problem. The experimental results show that the introduction of phenological features into HRNet model training can effectively improve urban green space classification accuracy by solving the problem of misclassification of evergreen and deciduous trees. The improvement rate of F1-Score of deciduous trees, evergreen trees, and grassland were 0.48\%, 4.77\%, and 3.93\%, respectively, which proved that the combination of vegetation phenology and high-resolution remote sensing image can improve the results of deep learning urban green space classification. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract = {The real-time, accurate, and refined monitoring of urban green space status information is of great significance in the construction of urban ecological environment and the improvement of urban ecological benefits. The high-resolution technology can provide abundant information of ground objects, which makes the information of urban green surface more complicated. The existing classification methods are challenging to meet the classification accuracy and automation requirements of high-resolution images. This paper proposed a deep learning classification method for urban green space based on phenological features constraints in order to make full use of the spectral and spatial information of green space provided by high-resolution remote sensing images (GaoFen-2) in different periods. The vegetation phenological features were added as auxiliary bands to the deep learning network for training and classification. We used the HRNet (High-Resolution Network) as our model and introduced the Focal Tversky Loss function to solve the sample imbalance problem. The experimental results show that the introduction of phenological features into HRNet model training can effectively improve urban green space classification accuracy by solving the problem of misclassification of evergreen and deciduous trees. The improvement rate of F1-Score of deciduous trees, evergreen trees, and grassland were 0.48\%, 4.77\%, and 3.93\%, respectively, which proved that the combination of vegetation phenology and high-resolution remote sensing image can improve the results of deep learning urban green space classification. © 2020 by the authors.

  abstract = {Mapping urban vegetation is a prerequisite to accurately understanding landscape patterns and ecological services provided by urban vegetation. However, the uncertainties in fine-scale vegetation biodiversity mapping still exist in capturing vegetation functional types efficiently at fine scale. To facilitate the application of fine-scale vegetation spatial configuration used for urban landscape planning and ecosystem service valuation, we present an approach integrating object-based classification with vegetation phenology for fine-scale vegetation functional type mapping in compact city of Beijing, China. The phenological information derived from two WorldView-2 imagery scenes, acquired on 14 September 2012 and 26 November 2012, was used to aid in the classification of tree functional types and grass. Then we further compared the approach to that of using only one WorldView imagery. We found WorldView-2 imagery can be successfully applied to map functional types of urban vegetation with its high spatial resolution and relatively high spectral resolution. The application of the vegetation phenology into classification greatly improved the overall accuracy of classification from 82.3\% to 91.1\%. In particular, the accuracies of vegetation types was improved by from 10\% to 13.26\%. The approach integrating vegetation phenology with high-resolution remote sensed images provides an efficient tool to incorporate multi-temporal data into fine-scale urban classification. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH},

  abstract = {Ground reference data are an essential prerequisite for supervised crop mapping. The lack of a low-cost and efficient ground referencing method results in pervasively limited reference data and hinders crop classification. In this study, we apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to explore the efficacy of automatic ground truthing via Google Street View (GSV) images in two distinct farming regions: Illinois and the Central Valley in California. We demonstrate the feasibility and reliability of our new ground referencing technique by performing pixel-based crop mapping at the state level using the cloud-based Google Earth Engine platform. The mapping results are evaluated using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop data layer (CDL) products. From~\textasciitilde ~130,000 GSV images, the CNN model identified~\textasciitilde ~9,400 target crop images. These images are well classified into crop types, including alfalfa, almond, corn, cotton, grape, rice, soybean, and pistachio. The overall GSV image classification accuracy is 92\% for the Central Valley and 97\% for Illinois. Subsequently, we shifted the image geographical coordinates 2–3 times in a certain direction to produce 31,829 crop reference points: 17,358 in Illinois, and 14,471 in the Central Valley. Evaluation of the mapping results with CDL products revealed satisfactory coherence. GSV-derived mapping results capture the general pattern of crop type distributions for 2011–2019. The overall agreement between CDL products and our mapping results is indicated by R2 values of 0.44–0.99 for the Central Valley and 0.81–0.98 for Illinois. To show the applicational value of the proposed method in other countries, we further mapped rice paddy (2014–2018) in South Korea which yielded fairly well outcomes (R2~=~0.91). These results indicate that GSV images used with a deep learning model offer an efficient and cost-effective alternative method for ground referencing, in many regions of the world.},

  abstract = {Most studies on vegetation phenology along the urban–rural gradient (URG) have focused on inland cities, with a comparative lack of research on coastal cities despite their different climatic background. We used the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), land surface temperature (LST), and land cover data to determine spatiotemporal patterns in vegetation phenology with respect to LST along the URG in China's coastal \hspace{0pt}\hspace{0pt}Dalian sub-province, with a focus on the main city of Dalian and three sub-cities (Pulandian, Wafangdian, and Zhuanghe). Our results were well-correlated with MODIS Land Cover Dynamics Product (MCD12Q2) reference data and matched patterns found in previous studies, indicating that the amplitude method of TIMESAT for obtaining vegetation phenology is practical. Start of growing season (SOS) and end of growing season (EOS) of urban areas were earlier and later than rural areas, respectively. The four urban areas had dissimilar vegetation types and urbanization levels leading to different changes in SOS and EOS along the URG; the average △SOS (the difference in SOS along the URG) and △EOS (the difference in EOS along the URG) of the main and sub-cities were 7.4 and 5.0 d, respectively. Changes in LST along the URG exhibited a non-linear relationship, with the maximum usually appearing 6–8 km from the urban areas. There was a strong linear relationship between vegetation phenology and LST along the URG. The winter–spring and yearly LSTs were negatively correlated with SOS, with both having roughly similar effects. The fall and yearly LSTs had significantly positive correlations with EOS, with the latter having a stronger effect. This study will be helpful for understanding climatic changes arising from urbanization in coastal areas and improving the management and productivity of the ecological environment. © 2020},

However, the issue on what the relationships between POIs and urbanization, and how do POIs affect urban forest was rarely mentioned in previous studies. In our research, a total of 82,978 POI records (reclassed to 7 categories of catering and restaurants, commercial areas, educational and institutional areas, public services, residential areas, scenic spots and shopping areas) were collected to analyze their influence on woody plant diversity and urban forest landscape metrics according to a distance gradient using field measurements of diversity and imagery delineated urban forest patches. The results revealed that the urbanization intensity (computed as impervious surface area proportion) was linearly decreased with the increase of distance from POIs except for scenic spots. When it close to POIs, the woody plant species richness, Shannon-Wiener diversity and evenness gradually increased, whereas the Simpson's diversity decreased. Meanwhile, the urban forest patches delineated from fine-resolution images got smaller, less shape complexity and fragmented with mean patch area (AREA\_MN), area-weighted mean shape index (SHAPE\_AM) and area-weighted mean contiguity index (CONTIG\_AM) decreased and patch density (PD) increased. This study can improve our understanding on the diversity, distribution of urban forest and its relationship with human activities, and guide us in urban forest planning and management. © 2020 The Authors},

  abstract = {Climate conditions are the major driving factors of vegetation phenology. However, there is limited effort to monitor dynamics of vegetation phenology and its responses to climate change and urbanization. Using NDVI data from 1982 to 2015, this study investigated the spatiotemporal change of spring green-up date (GUD) across the Yellow River Basin (YRB) and estimated the possible effects of different climatic factors on it. Additionally, the urban-rural differences in GUD and its linkage to spring land surface temperature (LST) for YRB's major cities over 2001–2015 were investigated. The results showed that the GUD significantly advanced at a rate of 0.42 days yr−1 and delayed spatially from southeast to northwest. The interannual variations in regionally averaged GUD were driven mainly by preseason min-temperature (Tmin). Spatially, the effect of preseason Tmin was strongest in the central and western region. The confounding effects of preseason maximum temperature (Tmax) and precipitation jointly affected the GUD, while insolation had a weak impact on GUD. Moreover, the sensitivity of GUD to preseason Tmin and precipitation weakened with an increasing mean annual preseason precipitation gradient, but the sensitivity to preseason Tmax was gradually enhanced. Furthermore, the difference in the GUD between urban and rural areas presented a significant logarithmic relationship with the distance away from the urban center, and it was strongly related to the regional LST. Our findings confirmed the importance of Tmin and urbanization in regulating changes in GUD and further suggested that LST should be considered to develop an improved model of GUD under future climate change and urban development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

Urbanization and the resultant "urban heat islands" provide a means for evaluating the effect of climate warming on vegetation phenology. Using data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, we analyzed urban-rural differences in vegetation phenological transition dates and land surface temperatures for urban areas larger than 10 km2 in eastern North America. The results show that the effect of urban climates on vegetation phenology decays exponentially with distance from urban areas with substantial influence up to 10 km beyond the edge of urban land cover, and that the ecological "footprint" of urban climates is about 2.4 times that of urban land use in eastern North America. The net effect is an increase in the growing season by about 15 days in urban areas relative to adjacent unaffected rural areas. Copyright 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.},

  abstract = {Recent studies using both field measurements and satellite-derived-vegetation indices have demonstrated that global warming is influencing vegetation growth and phenology. To accurately predict the future response of vegetation to climate variation, a thorough understanding of vegetation phenological cycles and their relationship to temperature and precipitation is required. In this paper, vegetation phenological transition dates identified using data from the moderate-resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) in 2001 are linked with MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data from the northern hemisphere between 35°N and 70°N. The results show well-defined patterns dependent on latitude, in which vegetation greenup gradually migrates northward starting in March, and dormancy spreads southward from late September. Among natural vegetation land-cover types, the growing-season length for forests is strongly correlated with variation in mean annual LST. For urban areas, the onset of greenup is 4-9 days earlier on average, and the onset of dormancy is about 2-16 days later, relative to adjacent natural vegetation. This difference (especially for urban vs. forests) is apparently related to urban heat island effects that result in both the average spring temperature and the mean annual temperature in urban areas being about 1-3°C higher relative to rural areas. The results also indicate that urban heat island effects on vegetation phenology are stronger in North America than in Europe and Asia. Finally, the onset of forest greenup at continental scales can be effectively described using a thermal time-chilling model, which can be used to infer the delay or advance of greenup onset in relation to climatic warming at global scale. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

  abstract = {Estimating the net primary production (NPP) of vegetation is essential for eco-environment conservation and carbon cycle research. Remote sensing techniques, combined with algorithm models, have been proven to be promising methods for NPP estimation. High-precision and real-time NPP monitoring in heterogeneous areas requires high spatio-temporal resolution remote sensing data, which are not easy to acquire by single remote sensors, especially in cloudy weather. This study proposes to fuse images of different sensors to provide high spatio-temporal resolution data for NPP estimation in cloud-prone areas. Firstly, the time series Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) with a spatial resolution of 30 m and a temporal resolution of 16 days, are obtained by the enhanced spatial and temporal adaptive reflectance fusion model (ESTARFM). Then, the time series NDVI data, combined with meteorological data are input into an improved Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model for NPP estimation. This method is validated by a case study of a heavily urbanized area, in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in China. The results indicate that the NPP estimated by the fused NDVI data has more detailed spatial information than by using the MODIS data. The results show a strong correlation between the actual Landsat8 NDVI and the fused NDVI images, which means that the accuracy of synthetic NDVI images (a 16 day interval and a 30 m resolution) is reliable, and it can provide superior inputs for accurate estimations of a NPP time series. The correlation coefficient (R) and root mean square error between the NPP, based on the fused NDVI and the measured NPP, are 0.66 and 14.280 g C/(m2.yr), respectively, indicating a good consistency. The small discrepancy is caused by the uncertainties of fused NDVI, measurement errors, conversion errors, and other factors in the CASA model. In this study, we achieved NPP with high spatial and temporal resolutions, which can provide higher accuracies of NPP data for analyzing the carbon cycling heavily urbanized areas, compared with similar studies using mono-temporal NPP data. The spatio-temporal fusion technique is an effective way of generating high spatio-temporal resolution images from different sensors, thereby providing enough data for NPP monitoring in urbanized areas. © 2019 by the authors.},

  abstract = {Climate change is affecting tree growth and vitality, including potentially accelerating growth rate or exacerbating drought stress. Physiological and phenological changes of a tree may eventually disrupt the beneficial effects that it provides to the ecosystem (‘ecosystem services’). This research examined how the urban forest in Canberra has responded to climate change in the last 20 years. A road survey was conducted to document the growth of commonly planted trees across the city, which was then compared with a tree growth model (DISMUT) that reflected growth around the turn of the 20th century. The results suggest that urban trees have various mechanisms whereby they respond to climate change, and these mechanisms are partially based on tolerance to heat and drought, leaf phenology and age. In general, trees with high tolerance, evergreen leaves and young age grow faster and bigger than expected, while drought-intolerant, deciduous and older trees are more likely to exhibit restricted size. Water deficit is one of the main threats to tree vitality in Canberra. Species alleviate water deficit stress by forming dead branches or showing crown dieback. However, these symptoms undermine the ecosystem services that urban trees can provide. Urban forest management should be modified to adapt to the changes in trees, including accelerated growth and severe stress symptoms. DISMUT models can be updated to incorporate the systematic deviations in growth to improve predictions and scenario planning. © 2020 Elsevier GmbH},

  abstract = {Urbanization, a dominant global demographic trend, leads to various changes in environments (e.g., atmospheric CO2 increase, urban heat island). Cities experience global change decades ahead of other systems so that they are natural laboratories for studying responses of other nonurban biological ecosystems to future global change. However, the impacts of urbanization on vegetation growth are not well understood. Here, we developed a general conceptual framework for quantifying the impacts of urbanization on vegetation growth and applied it in 32 Chinese cities. Results indicated that vegetation growth, as surrogated by satellite-observed vegetation index, decreased along urban intensity across all cities. At the same time, vegetation growth was enhanced at 85\% of the places along the intensity gradient, and the relative enhancement increased with urban intensity. This growth enhancement offset about 40\% of direct loss of vegetation productivity caused by replacing productive vegetated surfaces with nonproductive impervious surfaces. In light of current and previous field studies, we conclude that vegetation growth enhancement is prevalent in urban settings. Urban environments do provide ideal natural laboratories to observe biological responses to environmental changes that are difficult to mimic in manipulative experiments. However, one should be careful in extrapolating the finding to nonurban environments because urban vegetation is usually intensively managed, and attribution of the responses to diverse driving forces will be challenging but must be pursued.},

  abstract = {Three large cities in Northeast China (Shenyang, Changchun and Harbin) and their surrounding rural areas are taken as the study units. The wavelet transform method is used to reduce the noise data of long time series Moderate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) enhanced vegetation index (EVI) data and reconstructed smooth EVI curves in pixel scale. Based on EVI curves, the key vegetation phenological parameter indexes from 2009 to 2016, namely the start of growing season (SOS) and the end of growing season (EOS) are extracted by using the dynamic threshold method. The spatio-temporal change of vegetation phenology and their responses to surface temperature in each study unit are analyzed. The results show that the differences in the spatial distribution of the SOS and the EOS in each study unit are significant between urban area and rural area. The area where a smaller value of SOS is taken is consistent with the area where a larger value of EOS is taken, and vice versa. The spatial distribution of vegetation phenology indexes and their geographical locations (either urban or rural) are highly consistent. The closer the actual location of each pixel is to its urban center, the smaller the SOS value is and the larger the EOS value is, which indicates an early start and a late end of the growing season, that is, a longer growing season. From 2009 to 2016, the average annual SOS values in these 3 cities form an early center in the urban areas and show a tendency of gradual delay from the urban area to the rural area, whereas the average annual EOS values form a late center in urban areas and show a tendency of gradual advance from the urban area to the niral area. The SOS is between the 99th and the 112nd day in urban areas, while the SOS is between the 125th day and the 135th day in rural areas. The time difference of urban-rural SOS is about 3 weeks. The EOS is between the 293rd and the 300th day in urban areas, while the EOS is between the 284th and the 286th day in rural areas. The urban EOS is approximately 2 weeks later than that in rural areas. The inter-annual change trend of vegetation phenological parameter indexes in each study unit has some similarities, that is, SOS shows an early trend with time, and the trend of SOS inter- A nnual change in urban and rural areas is consistent but with different rale. The maximum of the SOS value during the study period occurred in 2012 in the study areas, which was the coldest year in terms of vegetation phonological indexes and this coincided with the climatic phenomena of extreme weather such as blizzard and low temperature, which were affected by the cold wave in the year. The average annual land surface temperature ( LST) of each study unit is significantly correlated with the corresponding vegetation phenological indexes. There is a significant negative correlation between SOS and LST, and a high positive correlation between EOS and LST. The higher the average temperature of the same vegetation phenological period, the earlier the start time of vegetation growth season, and the later the end time of vegetation growth season. © 2020 Science Press.

  abstract = {Unmanned aerial system (UAS)-based remote sensing is one promising technique for precision crop management, but few studies have reported the applications of such systems on nitrogen (N) estimation with multiple sensors in rice (Oryza sativa L.). This study aims to evaluate three sensors (RGB, color-infrared (CIR) and multispectral (MS) cameras) onboard UAS for the estimation of N status at individual stages and their combination with the field data collected from a two-year rice experiment. The experiments were conducted in 2015 and 2016, involving different N rates, planting densities and rice cultivars, with three replicates. An Oktokopter UAS was used to acquire aerial photography at early growth stages (from tillering to booting) and field samplings were taken at a near date. Two color indices (normalized excess green index (NExG), and normalized green red difference index (NGRDI)), two near infrared vegetation indices (green normalized difference vegetation index (GNDVI), and enhanced NDVI (ENDVI)) and two red edge vegetation indices (red edge chlorophyll index (CIred edge), and DATT) were used to evaluate the capability of these three sensors in estimating leaf nitrogen accumulation (LNA) and plant nitrogen accumulation (PNA) in rice. The results demonstrated that the red edge vegetation indices derived from MS images produced the highest estimation accuracy for LNA (R2: 0.79–0.81, root mean squared error (RMSE): 1.43–1.45 g m−2) and PNA (R2: 0.81–0.84, RMSE: 2.27–2.38 g m−2). The GNDVI from CIR images yielded a moderate estimation accuracy with an all-stage model. Color indices from RGB images exhibited satisfactory performance for the pooled dataset of the tillering and jointing stages. Compared with the counterpart indices from the RGB and CIR images, the indices from the MS images performed better in most cases. These results may set strong foundations for the development of UAS-based rice growth monitoring systems, providing useful information for the real-time decision making on crop N management.},

  abstract = {Despite documented intra-urban heterogeneity in the urban heat island (UHI) effect, little is known about spatial or temporal variability in plant response to the UHI. Using an automated temperature sensor network in conjunction with Landsat-derived remotely sensed estimates of start/end of the growing season, we investigate the impacts of the UHI on plant phenology in the city of Madison WI (USA) for the 2012–2014 growing seasons. Median urban growing season length (GSL) estimated from temperature sensors is ∼5 d longer than surrounding rural areas, and UHI impacts on GSL are relatively consistent from year-to-year. Parks within urban areas experience a subdued expression of GSL lengthening resulting from interactions between the UHI and a park cool island effect. Across all growing seasons, impervious cover in the area surrounding each temperature sensor explains {$>$}50\% of observed variability in phenology. Comparisons between long-term estimates of annual mean phenological timing, derived from remote sensing, and temperature-based estimates of individual growing seasons show no relationship at the individual sensor level. The magnitude of disagreement between temperature-based and remotely sensed phenology is a function of impervious and grass cover surrounding the sensor, suggesting that realized GSL is controlled by both local land cover and micrometeorological conditions.},

  abstract = {Urban green areas are experiencing rapid land cover change caused by human-induced land degradation and extreme climatic events. Vegetation index timeseries provide a useful way to monitor urban vegetation phenological variations. This study quantitatively describes Normalized Difference Vegetation Index NDVI) /Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Leaf Area Index (LAI) temporal changes for Bucharest metropolitan region land cover in Romania from the perspective of vegetation phenology and its relation with climate changes and extreme climate events. The time series from 2000 to 2016 of the NOAA AVHRR and MODIS Terra/Aqua satellite data were analyzed to extract anomalies. Time series of climatic variables were also analyzed through anomaly detection techniques and the Fourier Transform. Correlations between NDVI/EVI time series and climatic variables were computed. Temperature, rainfall and radiation were significantly correlated with almost all land-cover classes for the harmonic analysis amplitude term. However, vegetation phenology was not correlated with climatic variables for the harmonic analysis phase term suggesting a delay between climatic variations and vegetation response. Training and validation were based on a reference dataset collected from IKONOS high resolution remote sensing data. The mean detection accuracy for period 2000- 2016 was assessed to be of 87\%, with a reasonable balance between change commission errors (19.3\%), change omission errors (24.7\%), and Kappa coefficient of 0.73. This paper demonstrates the potential of moderate - and high resolution, multispectral imagery to map and monitor the evolution of the physical urban green land cover under climate and anthropogenic pressure. © 2017 SPIE.},
