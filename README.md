# berlin.trees

## Purpose

This repository contains an analysis of tree growth (potential) and its
relationship with the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect in Berlin using an
extensive, publicly available data set. For some details of the
(on-going) research, download this [file](./analysis/paper/paper.html)

## Approach

The folder structure follows the principal of a [research
compendium](https://research-compendium.science/) following concepts
developed by [Ben Marwick and
others](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00031305.2017.1375986?journalCode=utas20).
That means all analyses and the final write-up are organized in a
(fairly) coherent manner, encouraing reproducibility.

I chose to package up the analyses in an `R` package to facilitate
reproducibility, as dependencies are more easily tracked, and analyses
steps can be broken down into functions that can be tested, adjusted
when necessary, and most important, re-used.
